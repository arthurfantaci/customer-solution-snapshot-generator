<h1>Transcript</h1>
<ul>
<li>Filip And it's recording alright perfect.</li>
<li>Arthur Yeah.</li>
<li>So we'll take this transcript, having covered each of those elements.</li>
<li>Arthur And then my plan is just to Arthur use Qlik Answers to Arthur make our lives easier, to generate Arthur a draft document that Arthur well, then, we can just touch it up over the course of the 2 weeks, and at the end.</li>
<li>Filip That sounds great.</li>
<li>Arthur Yeah, so good.</li>
<li>All right.</li>
<li>I would love unless you're would you rather go through the questions first, or do you want to go through your project plan?</li>
<li>First, let's go through the questions.</li>
<li>Let's get the formalities first.</li>
<li>Okay?</li>
<li>Sounds good.</li>
<li>Let me.</li>
<li>Arthur I'm gonna pull up my Arthur email just to go through each of the Arthur individual questions.</li>
<li>Arthur Okay, great.</li>
<li>So Arthur we'll just go through them in in turn.</li>
<li>So the first question is the Company Name.</li>
<li>Is Percona the entire company name, or is it Percona Inc. or is there a different name?</li>
<li>The next question is Company Industry.</li>
<li>Arthur What is Percona's Industry?</li>
<li>Filip It's databases services.</li>
<li>Arthur Okay, thanks.</li>
<li>I was not familiar with Percona, but Arthur now I am, and I'm glad to know Arthur The next question is Company Location.</li>
<li>Where is Percona located?</li>
<li>Filip The Percona company headquarters is located in Raleigh, North Carolina, United States.</li>
<li>Arthur Okay.</li>
<li>And the next question is Company Contact.</li>
<li>I'm assuming you and I will be working together, and that you, Filip Hanaczewski, are the Company Contact.</li>
<li>The next question is the Company Contact Role.</li>
<li>22 Filip Yes, I am the correct person to list as the Company Contact.</li>
<li>Filip My title is Senior Business Systems Analyst, and my title should be listed as the Company Contact Role.</li>
<li>Arthur Alright, thank you, Filip.</li>
<li>Let's begin discussing the purpose of this project we're here today to kick off?</li>
<li>What activities will Qlik Professional Services be performing and what deliverables will Qlik Professional Services be delivering for Percona during the course of this project?</li>
<li>Filip Okay, so Filip our plan is to get data and analytics Filip adopted in Percona because we are really struggling with it.</li>
<li>Filip The plan is to make the data and analytics like Business Intelligence tool and Filip data literacy data cataloging more Filip available and approachable Filip for the entire company.</li>
<li>Percona will start small.</li>
<li>There will be just few people that will be starting with Qlik Filip to use it, and then we will propagate the knowledge Filip to a wider audience.</li>
<li>Filip 1st of all, we will want to create some trainings Filip based on your experience based on Qlik's Filip learning resources.</li>
<li>Filip That's what we will want to bring to Percona Filip with this Qlik Professional Services engagement.</li>
<li>Filip And the Filip deliverables that we are thinking, like the measurable things that we want to get out of this Professional Services engagement Filip are, first off, the Booking Data Dashboard that will be available for the Percona Finance Team.</li>
<li>Secondly, the Percona Revenue Operations Team, as well as the wider audience Filip connected to Percona's ServiceNow data.</li>
<li>I am having a problem with the Qlik ServiceNow Data Connector.</li>
<li>The Filip out-of-the-box Qlik ServiceNow Data Connector doesn't work properly, and I'm struggling with the API.</li>
<li>So that's the second thing.</li>
<li>And the third thing is Training Materials.</li>
<li>Preparation of Training Materials is the third Filip goal, together with the Filip with Data Catalog preparation.</li>
<li>So, Filip we want to have a set of information for new users that will be Filip joining Percona's Qlik Cloud Platform and will be able to use the tool, and we want to address them with the Training Materials first, and then we would want to provide them access to some type of Data Catalog, so they will be able to see what kind of data sets do they have, what kind of data is in those data sets, and what kinds of Filip Data Visualizations or Qlik Dashboards we already have.</li>
<li>Filip This kind of stuff is the 3rd goal and is the least important at this point, but I would want to address it, also, if we'll have time.</li>
<li>Arthur Okay, thank you.</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>In 99% of my Arthur experiences with engagements of this kind, no one is able to articulate as clearly as you just did what they want to get out of the engagement.</li>
<li>So this is terrific, and I embrace your third point Arthur because it's soon enough that the first two priorities will be met, and then ongoing you'll be left with needing to meet your third priority of how to onboard Arthur new users to the Qlik Cloud Platform, as well as foster their productive use of the platform.</li>
<li>So, Arthur what we can do over the next day is Arthur brainstorm and Arthur scope out what we need to get done, and then prioritize those items and identify what we can actually get done within this engagement's allowable time.</li>
<li>So at a minimum for the third point, Arthur you and I can work together to make sure that we at least have a framework, if not, Arthur you know, specific deliverables for that 3rd objective of Training, Onboarding, and those kinds of activities.</li>
<li>Filip Excellent.</li>
<li>Arthur Okay.</li>
<li>Arthur Yeah, Training, Onboarding, and those kinds of activities have been a real interest of mine over the last few years.</li>
<li>Arthur I digress a bit here, but Arthur how do you put Arthur that type of Arthur resource into a in a digestible Arthur medium, so that people actually use it, you know.</li>
<li>Arthur So yeah.</li>
<li>So I'm glad to have that third point be a part of this engagement.</li>
<li>Arthur Okay, that was terrific.</li>
<li>And Arthur all right.</li>
<li>So let's talk about the solution.</li>
<li>Some of these points.</li>
<li>Clearly, we won't Arthur be, or I won't, because you won't have to draft any of this, but I'll be grateful for your oversight and Arthur approval of the content.</li>
<li>Arthur In terms of the solutions we deliver during this engagement, is Percona on Arthur the Qlik Windows Enterprise platform or the Qlik Cloud platform?</li>
<li>Filip Percona is on the Qlik Cloud platform.</li>
<li>75 Arthur That's great.</li>
<li>Okay, good.</li>
<li>Is Percona using any of the Qlik Data Integration Arthur components of the Qlik Cloud platform?</li>
<li>Or is this engagement focused entirely on Qlik Cloud Analytics and Qlik Sense application development?</li>
<li>Because I did, thank you very much, get access right away to Percona's Qlik Cloud Tenant Arthur from the link you provided me.</li>
<li>So this engagement will be focused on Qlik Cloud Analytics and Qlik Sense Arthur in terms of the tools and components we'll be using.</li>
<li>Okay, yeah.</li>
<li>Filip Yes, Qlik Sense.</li>
<li>Well, Qlik Cloud, I'm not sure of the naming of the specific Qlik product that Percona has licensed from Qlik.</li>
<li>But I think Qlik Sense.</li>
<li>But it's the Qlik Cloud Platform version of Qlik Sense, and we don't have any specific Qlik product components or integrations added to Percona's Qlik Cloud Platform.</li>
<li>I was recently talking with Qlik Talend about the Qlik Cloud Data Integration products and capabilities, because Percona is also looking at the Qlik Cloud version of the Qlik Data Integration Platform as an additional piece of the Qlik Cloud Platform to license from Qlik.</li>
<li>Filip But Percona hasn't made any decisions or affirmative steps around licensing any components of the Qlik Data Integration Platform.</li>
<li>So Percona Filip just has the Qlik Cloud instance that you got invited to log into as a user.</li>
<li>Please let me know if you are missing any privileges to see something more, because we don't have much implemented in our Qlik Cloud instance yet.</li>
<li>If there would be something more that you need, just let me know, and I'll change it.</li>
<li>Arthur Oh, that's great.</li>
<li>I appreciate that.</li>
<li>So after we've ended this first meeting, I'll go drive around the Percona Qlik Cloud instance and take a look.</li>
<li>I'm laughing because Arthur you can join the club in terms of confusion about Qlik's product naming conventions.</li>
<li>It's the same for me.</li>
<li>Things Arthur things change so quickly.</li>
<li>So you articulated it beautifully.</li>
<li>So there's none of the Talend Qlik Data Integration Arthur components.</li>
<li>And we're just gonna be working right on the Percona Qlik Cloud Tenant.</li>
<li>So that's perfect.</li>
<li>Arthur All right, and let me look at the next question, Product and Service Use.</li>
<li>We've already talked about the Implementation Process question.</li>
<li>So now let's Arthur discuss my activities and deliverables for next day or so.</li>
<li>After I complete those activities and deliverables, we can plan to meet Arthur and we'll walk through what I think would be, Arthur I hope, an acceptable work plan and how we'll get things done for the duration of this current engagement.</li>
<li>Arthur So that's the solution piece for Arthur the Engagement Outline document, as well as the details and timelines of this engagement.</li>
<li>So we know, today's date, Monday, July 14, 2024 will be the answer to the 'Start Date' question.</li>
<li>Arthur And with this engagement budgeted for eighty hours, we know the answer to the 'End Date' question will be Friday, July 26, 2024.</li>
<li>And the answers to some of these questions aren't set in stone.</li>
<li>For instance, we have a set block of eighty billable hours.</li>
<li>Arthur My way of working is, Arthur you know, we'll make sure we get down on paper and agree very quickly about what we want to get done in the eighty hours of billable time.</li>
<li>But if it takes a few hours extra here or there, that's irrelevant.</li>
<li>It's not going to be, "I've burned through my allotted hours, and now I'll stop working" or something like that.</li>
<li>Arthur To answer the 'Engagement Team' question, let's just list out the individuals from Percona and Qlik that we envision participating in this engagement, and also, for instance, any relevant Project Stakeholders.</li>
<li>Arthur I know this isn't a very big project.</li>
<li>But if there are other people that aren't direct members of the 'Engagement Team', like, for instance, Approvers or Steering Committee members, if you will.</li>
<li>Arthur Identifying those types of individuals will assist in answering the question about 'Milestones' because if those individuals need to be apprised over the course of this engagement, and you know what information we would need to provide them, we can create specific 'Milestones' to document those requirements.</li>
<li>Filip Okay.</li>
<li>So our plan was to Filip get the engagement with the Qlik Professional Services Team, or you, Arthur Fantaci, specifically Filip for about a week and work with you on the most problematic the issue with the Qlik ServiceNow Data Connector; the Percona Booking Data Qlik Sense application (i.e., Booking Data Dashboard), specifically the data and initial dashboard preparation based on the data that is already imported into Percona's Qlik Cloud platform.</li>
<li>Filip Because I was able to prepare the data set for the Booking Data Dashboard.</li>
<li>It's not perfect.</li>
<li>We will talk about it in upcoming calls we need to schedule, probably during the calls we schedule to discuss the scope of the Booking Data Dashboard development.</li>
<li>Filip The thing is, that Percona would want to have like a week-long initial engagement Filip first, Filip where we will see what was done by Qlik Professional Services, and then we would want to pause this engagement for an indeterminate period to allow Percona to get acquainted with that specific work and deliverables.</li>
<li>Filip And after that pause, Percona would want re-engage with Qlik Professional Services, with some more questions, and resume the engagement for the remaining duration of forty billable hours.</li>
<li>Filip What we don't understand, but we will not be able to reproduce ourselves, because we don't understand some pieces of it, and then we would want to get the like.</li>
<li>The second week of this engagement.</li>
<li>If that makes sense for the activities and deliverables necessary to address the Training and Data Cataloging areas of interest.</li>
<li>And all of this area encompassing the Filip Data Governance piece, as well as Filip more questions and so on.</li>
<li>I'm not sure if Filip one week, this first week will be enough Filip to deliver the Booking Data Dashboard and resolve the issue with the Qlik ServiceNow Data Connector, enabling access to the ServiceNow data and integration with the ServiceNow database.</li>
<li>Filip If that will be not enough, we can take more time.</li>
<li>But Percona would want to get some break in the middle, so we can get acquainted with what was done and get back to Qlik Professional Services with questions.</li>
<li>Filip Okay.</li>
<li>Filip So that's like the overall timeline Filip that we see.</li>
<li>There are no hard deadlines for Percona for when this needs to be done.</li>
<li>Filip And the answer to the 'Engagement Team' question will be me Filip and my director, Eduardo Casareo.</li>
<li>Filip Eduardo Casareo will be the decision maker, probably with any need to increase the number of Qlik Professional Service's billable hours or any additional engagements with Qlik Professional Services.</li>
<li>If either of those contingencies were going to happen.</li>
<li>Filip And the other member of the 'Engagement Team' from Percona will be Amal Naik, from the Percona Finance Team.</li>
<li>Filip Amal Naik is a Senior Financial Analyst with Percona.</li>
<li>Amal Naik is the primary stakeholder of the Booking Data Dashboard.</li>
<li>Amal will be maintaining the Booking Data Dashboard, changing it, and improving it, based on the requirements he receives from other Percona Finance Team Stakeholders.</li>
<li>Filip And another member of the 'Engagement Team' but Filip less involved, will be Shannon Lastname.</li>
<li>Filip Shannon Lastname is Amal Naik's Filip manager.</li>
<li>And the final member of the 'Engagement Team' from Percona is this engagement's Filip sponsor, Eileen Bigwig.</li>
<li>Filip That's like the whole team from Percona that will be working on this small project, and each of their names should be added as responses to the 'Engagement Team' question.</li>
<li>Arthur Okay, that's perfect, and what we can do is one thing I love about using, recording the meeting and using the transcript is, I'll come back to you just to confirm spellings and titles for the folks we just talked about.</li>
<li>Arthur So we don't have to worry about it right now, and agreed.</li>
<li>So from Qlik Professional Services, the names that should be added as responses to the 'Engagement Team' question Arthur Fantaci and Mark Vincze.</li>
<li>So I'll give you just the quick version of my background.</li>
<li>So my name is Arthur Fantaci and I've been with Qlik for the past six years.</li>
<li>I've been working with the Qlik platform for over 10 years.</li>
<li>I've been focused on Qlik Sense for the last Arthur 5 or 6 years.</li>
<li>Arthur I tend to Arthur focus on the Data Modeling process all the way Arthur into Dashboard design Arthur and creation, as well as Arthur the more recent Arthur features in the Qlik Cloud Platform, like Arthur Qlik Alerting.</li>
<li>Or, for instance, the Qlik Answers product launch is coming up.</li>
<li>So I've spent the last month Arthur getting up to speed on the pre-release version of that product.</li>
<li>Arthur I have about 25 plus years in this Business Intelligence game.</li>
<li>Arthur And that's my background.</li>
<li>Filip We are very excited to begin this engagement.</li>
<li>Filip I see Filip we are in good hands.</li>
<li>Arthur I hope so.</li>
<li>I very much enjoy what I do.</li>
<li>This engagement appears to present a lot of opportunity to build a great foundation.</li>
<li>I'll also be supported by Arthur the Qlik Professional Services folks that you've been on the phone with during your previous calls this past April and June.</li>
<li>So, for instance, Mark Vincze, is someone who, one of the people I would report up into and he's in management of Qlik Professional Services, but he has many years under his belt of delivering Qlik implementations Arthur and Lance Anderson Arthur again, also from a platform implementation and maintenance.</li>
<li>And obviously because I'm with Qlik, I have access to resources.</li>
<li>So if there are questions that come up along the way, and then also Arthur I can give you, I'm happy to provide Arthur advice about how to navigate Qlik as an organization.</li>
<li>So you know, in terms of support.</li>
<li>Arthur getting previews or access or things like that without Arthur they basically skipping, skipping the line.</li>
<li>So alright, and I think we've talked pretty well about.</li>
<li>So I appreciate the you sharing the team from your side.</li>
<li>Based our conversation thus far, I think we've answered the 'Overview' question.</li>
<li>Arthur Alright, let's discuss how to answer the 'Post Implementation' question.</li>
<li>Arthur I guess this would be a good time.</li>
<li>So for key milestones and post implementation, which we can kind of consider post implementation, a milestone as well.</li>
<li>I understand what you shared with me about.</li>
<li>We want to see what we want to see, what we can get done in a 40 h block.</li>
<li>Arthur and then provide an opportunity for you all Arthur to digest what has been delivered.</li>
<li>Arthur and then come back with another block.</li>
<li>Ideally 40 h Arthur to address what comes up during that Arthur break period.</li>
<li>Filip That's super!</li>
<li>Arthur Okay?</li>
<li>So I think kind of naturally, then, would be, for instance, a Milestone would be the end of this, the end of the 1st block.</li>
<li>Arthur The beginning of the Arthur second block Arthur which would largely be Arthur you and your colleagues presenting Arthur what you want to get out of the second Arthur block of time, Arthur and then Arthur a meeting or review at the end of that second 40 hours.</li>
<li>Arthur And so one thing I can think of for this week, or say over the next 24 Arthur to 48 hours would be for you and I Arthur to create some sort Arthur of work plan Arthur for this 1st block, Arthur and what we anticipate currently for the second block, because we don't quite know what you're going to get, but I feel like, perhaps by the end of the day tomorrow, Tuesday, July 16, 2024 or before noon on Wednesday, July 17, 2024.</li>
<li>Arthur we're gonna want to Arthur agree on and create a Phase One Work Plan Document that details what are we delivering Arthur this week Arthur in terms of whether we'll have enough time to Arthur fix the Qlik ServiceNow Data Connector, Arthur how much can we get built out of the Booking Data Dashboard, Arthur and then for the Training Material?</li>
<li>And I know it sounds a little silly that the Engagement's Phase One will only be 5 days long, and we wouldn't review a first draft of the Phase One Work Plan Document until the end of the Engagement's Phase One second day or the beginning of the Engagement's Phase One third day.</li>
<li>Arthur Does that make sense that within the next Arthur day and a half to 2 days we draft a Phase One Work Plan Document?</li>
<li>I'll draft the initial Phase One Work Plan Document that we can review and agree that it contains Arthur an accurate depiction of our Engagement Roadmap or Engagement Work Plan for delivery of Engagement Phase One activities and deliverables.</li>
<li>Do you agree with that approach, Filip?</li>
<li>Filip All right.</li>
<li>Great.</li>
<li>That sounds good, and so I don't really know about in terms of the break how we incorporate that into the current Engagement.</li>
<li>Arthur The beauty of being the client is you're the client, so we'll figure out how to make this work.</li>
<li>And another reason, I think it's important that we Arthur document these kinds of things.</li>
<li>If whatever reason, I'm not the person who is working with you at the second piece.</li>
<li>I anticipate I will be.</li>
<li>But if there's a break we'll just need to make sure about that.</li>
<li>Arthur We'll make sure there won't be any hiccups or Arthur learning curve if a different Qlik Professional Services Consultant is assigned to complete the Engagement's second half (i.e., Phase Two).</li>
<li>Arthur Alright.</li>
<li>So that sounds good for the Engagement's Filip 'Results and Achievements' question.</li>
<li>Obviously.</li>
<li>Arthur I think this would be more of.</li>
<li>Arthur You've shared with me.</li>
<li>What your objectives are Arthur in relation to providing the details to answer the 'Quantifiable Arthur Improvements' question.</li>
<li>Arthur I believe 'Quantifiable Improvements' would be described as improvements Arthur over Percona's state of operations prior to implementing it's Qlik Cloud Platform and the completion of this engagement.</li>
<li>We don't need to be slavishly thorough here.</li>
<li>But are there things just Arthur off the top of your head that Arthur you're associating with Percona achieving the three things we talked about earlier.</li>
<li>Filip Yes, that's exactly how we can put it.</li>
<li>Filip If we accomplish the three things we talked about earlier, Percona will get a Booking Data Dashboard with reports and associated functionality at the end of the Engagement's entire eighty-hour block of billable hours.</li>
<li>Filip And Percona will have no further questions, and will understand how to start maintaining and improving the Booking Data Dashboard.</li>
<li>Filip That's a 'Quantifiable Improvement' associated with achieving the first of the three things we discussed earlier during this conversation.</li>
<li>Filip That will be a measurable result for Percona.</li>
<li>Filip The second measurable result will be resolving the current issue preventing Percona's use of the Qlik ServiceNow Data If the Qlik ServiceNow Data Connector will be working for the ServiceNow data Filip that we want to begin importing into Qlik Sense, and we are able to understand Filip how to write the connection Filip for the next Filip data sets that we will want to put in.</li>
<li>That's another measurable achievement for Percona.</li>
<li>Filip The third 'Quantifiable Improvement' will be the creation of a Data Catalogue or Data Catalogue for the Percona Teams using the Qlik Cloud Platform.</li>
<li>And Percona knowing how to improve the Data Catalogue and Filip and use it productively.</li>
<li>That achievement would be the 3rd thing.</li>
<li>Arthur Okay, and when you say Data Catalog, are you referring specifically to the Qlik Data Catalog component?</li>
<li>Or are you using the term 'Data Catalogue' in the generic sense?</li>
<li>Filip I am using the term 'Data Catalog' more generically.</li>
<li>I'm using it more generically.</li>
<li>We would want to introduce, like kind of a Data Catalog as a concept in Percona.</li>
<li>In general, we do not have.</li>
<li>I think we do not have the Qlik Data Catalog product if that's an actual Qlik product.</li>
<li>So when I refer to a Data Catalog, I'm thinking about a place where people would be able to just go in, see what's available and Filip read about this a bit to understand the data points that are there, and just make sure that Filip they know what Filip they can do with it.</li>
<li>Arthur Okay, I understand what you are saying, Arthur and Arthur we can come up with an initial scalable Data Catalog solution that you could implement just within Percona's existing Qlik Cloud Platform, using Qlik Sense.</li>
<li>So, for instance, Arthur whether it's within individual dashboards having one sheet Arthur that provides a catalog Arthur of the dimensions and measures.</li>
<li>Arthur with more with metadata associated Arthur with those elements, Arthur even rolling up the details for easy investigation.</li>
<li>Arthur So one, I think one step would be, you know.</li>
<li>Arthur at the individual application or dashboard level within boiling it up so that that information would be centralized so that the maintenance of it.</li>
<li>Arthur So, for instance, the Percona Finance Team Members using Qlik Sense could have, or will have ownership of that, so it won't be Arthur it is struggling Arthur to try and read minds or chase people to see if things have been updated.</li>
<li>So Arthur okay, yeah, and understood Arthur alright.</li>
<li>And so I think that covers that beautifully.</li>
<li>Arthur Okay, now let's discuss the question 'Adoption Usage'.</li>
<li>I think the answer to this question will be pretty straightforward.</li>
<li>As you said, Qlik Cloud is a new Arthur platform for Percona.</li>
<li>So we should just be able to use Arthur the existing Qlik Sense Administration Monitoring Arthur dashboard to measure New User rates Arthur as well as System Usage Rates by multiple dimensions.</li>
<li>Arthur Additionally, Arthur I can show you how to easily access the data populating that dashboard if for whatever reason you want to build a separate dashboard Arthur or extend that dashboard group.</li>
<li>Filip Excellent.</li>
<li>Yes.</li>
<li>Arthur Okay, great alright.</li>
<li>And Arthur let's see.</li>
<li>So we've attempted to answer the 'Results and Achievements' question, and we've also attempted to answer the 'Adoption and Usage' question.</li>
<li>That brings us to the 'Financial Impact' question.</li>
<li>Arthur To answer the 'Financial Impact' question we need to calculate Percona's anticipated Return on Investment (ROI).</li>
<li>Arthur Do you have thoughts about whether Percona is anticipating a positive Return on Investment from this engagement, and if there are specific use cases we can identify and use Arthur to measure and report the Return on Investment Arthur anticipated from successfully completing this engagement?</li>
<li>Filip It will be time saving definitely because we are trying to move Filip this this small project.</li>
<li>Let's call it a Proof of Concept (POC) of Qlik Filip should be like a guidance for bigger teams Filip to start adopting Qlik.</li>
<li>And with this engagement Filip we will not see a lot of improvement.</li>
<li>Filip it will be because Amal will be offloaded from the manual things that he would have to do on the spreadsheet and importing data and changing in data manually.</li>
<li>Filip but and of course, the way that the visualizations will be prepared would be much easier to understand and Filip beautiful, not like we have now.</li>
<li>Filip So that's Filip like minimal level that we will go with.</li>
<li>But the next step will be Filip to decrease the number of time that people are spend spending on preparation of any kind of reports that Filip we have in the Revenue Operations Team, for example, or in Filip and in the wider Financial Team or in Marketing.</li>
<li>Maybe this.</li>
<li>They are all connected with spreadsheets, Filip and with exporting and importing data.</li>
<li>Everything is in different places.</li>
<li>So it's hard to find.</li>
<li>It's not Filip unified between the teams.</li>
<li>So Filip if we will be able to adopt Qlik in all of those teams, it's going to be a time saver, and so resulting in cost savings.</li>
<li>Arthur That's perfect.</li>
<li>I appreciate it.</li>
<li>I do want to apologize.</li>
<li>I'm about to get up and take a toy away from my dog, Sadie, which I'm not sure if you can hear the squeaking she's making from playing with the toy.</li>
<li>Filip I also have one, my son, just my son just woke him up.</li>
<li>So Filip it's the same thing, I guess.</li>
<li>Arthur So.</li>
<li>Yeah, that sounds like we're in the same boat here.</li>
<li>Thank you for that.</li>
<li>That is very helpful.</li>
<li>It raises one question for me, which is in terms of dashboard development.</li>
<li>Arthur Upfront initially or moving forward.</li>
<li>Arthur How will the Qlik Sense dashboards be built?</li>
<li>Will Percona have a team of Qlik Sense Application Developers who'll be building those dashboards based on requirements Arthur from end users?</li>
<li>Or is the Qlik Sense dashboard development going to be blended where you're going to be Arthur empowering end users to create their own dashboards.</li>
<li>Filip More of the second approach.</li>
<li>I will be like a Data Engineer Architect that will be bringing the data in, together with the Data Stewards.</li>
<li>Filip I'll be preparing the data sets, and then the Data Stewards, Filip or particular Filip Percona Department Teams will be responsible for preparation of the Filip of the Qlik Sense dashboard visualizations.</li>
<li>That's why we would want to develop Filip this kind of Training Material we've been discussing, that will simplify the learning curve for them.</li>
<li>Filip We will also, me and Amal will be like the guidance for the newcomers, and we will help them adopt and understand how to use Qlik Sense.</li>
<li>Arthur So that's very helpful.</li>
<li>What I would foresee is that Arthur we will have Arthur two different segments of Qlik Users across Percona.</li>
<li>Arthur I would see the priority being, and forgive me because I don't know enough about your background.</li>
<li>But we would want to make sure that there's a structure around how Qlik Data Models are created.</li>
<li>So Arthur I would see if you're gonna have end users creating the front end, which is Arthur which is great.</li>
<li>I mean, that product is, you know, kind of architected for that.</li>
<li>Arthur You'd wanna have Arthur a library of data models.</li>
<li>Arthur That would be plug and play if you will, or Arthur for instance, beginning with QVDs.</li>
<li>Arthur then Qlik Sense applications that contain Qlik Data Models Arthur that could then just be Arthur attached, if you will, to a new Qlik Sense Arthur application.</li>
<li>And so the end user would never have to think about what Data Model they're using.</li>
<li>All they're doing is just focusing on Arthur creating visualizations based on known dimensions and measures.</li>
<li>Arthur So, yeah, that's that sounds exactly how you would want to approach this.</li>
<li>Filip If there will be some missing pieces in the data sets.</li>
<li>I would expect the Data Stewards to come to me, and we will work out the changes that should have been done on the data sets that are connected to the, to the Data Models, to the Qlik Sense applications.</li>
<li>Filip Okay, I understand what it is.</li>
<li>But I'm trying to learn it.</li>
<li>And I would appreciate your help with it.</li>
<li>If we will be using any of these during this engagement, I would be happy to see it.</li>
<li>Arthur Yeah, absolutely.</li>
<li>So I think what we could do is we can use the Booking Data Dashboard as a Use Case, if you will.</li>
<li>Filip Excellent for best practice for that so, for instance.</li>
<li>Filip the best practice would be something approximating a 3 tiered architecture, which is a very fancy way of saying a base layer of Filip where you would say import tables as a select star, and you would import those, let's say, on a daily basis.</li>
<li>Each table would be Filip converted each night into a Qvd.</li>
<li>Document.</li>
<li>Filip And then that way.</li>
<li>There's a single instance of that database table as a Qvd.</li>
<li>That can be reused many times, and then the second layer of the 3 pieces would be a data model where you are.</li>
<li>You create a Qlik Sense application Filip and using Qvd documents.</li>
<li>Filip and Filip you would then design a data model to support a particular domain.</li>
<li>So, for instance, finance Filip on.</li>
<li>Filip and then that sorry and that data model, it would then be reusable.</li>
<li>The objective would be Filip a data model that Filip could be reused by anyone who's interested in finance for whatever specific Filip objectives they have.</li>
<li>But everyone would be using Filip the same, the same data.</li>
<li>Filip and then the final tier of it would just be in the Ui.</li>
<li>Filip We'd make sure that there was a consistent.</li>
<li>We'd want to create master dimensions and master measures.</li>
<li>Filip So, for instance, if finance, if Perkona, for instance, had operating units in different geographies or different market segments that perhaps have a different Filip formula for revenue.</li>
<li>Filip We would want to create standard master measures for those.</li>
<li>Filip Exactly.</li>
<li>Yes.</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>Filip Okay, so.</li>
<li>And the good.</li>
<li>What I heard you say at the beginning of this call was something akin to beginning modestly and then iterating and scaling.</li>
<li>And so Filip what we can do over the we can just use that booking data.</li>
<li>Dashboard is an opportunity Filip to to do that.</li>
<li>So it sounds like we wanna make things that Filip we'll use this 1st phase I use the phrase, Filip I think it's called a self evidencing or self.</li>
<li>Basically what it is is the the thing we build will be an example of how to do what you want to do.</li>
<li>So the objective is, it won't just be.</li>
<li>We need to create booking dashboards.</li>
<li>But we need to create booking dashboards Filip in a method in which Filip that deliverable is instructive of how to Filip begin creating other dashboards in other areas of the business.</li>
<li>Filip Sounds excellent.</li>
<li>Filip Okay, yeah, I don't want to over promise.</li>
<li>But I think that's that will be a good approach.</li>
<li>Filip That sounds good approach for us.</li>
<li>Filip right?</li>
<li>And that's exactly what I was thinking about this kind of structure, where we will deliver self service for the users that will be educated enough to use it.</li>
<li>Filip That's great phrase.</li>
<li>So it sounds like, that's really the end game for you.</li>
<li>Filip okay, yeah.</li>
<li>I think that really does kind of it imposes a structure on how Filip you know what.</li>
<li>Filip what we're gonna want to get done Filip so that you have a chance to work with it.</li>
<li>I think it means more of a focus.</li>
<li>Filip I think it means more of a focus on the the development process, whether that's in the back end or the front end Filip and then with the service.</li>
<li>Now, Connector.</li>
<li>Filip I think what I'd like to do is Filip if we can take a look at that.</li>
<li>Filip and then I could just quickly identify.</li>
<li>If it's something that's either going to take me too long.</li>
<li>Filip or isn't something that I'm capable of getting done.</li>
<li>I can just quickly hand off Filip that task and the associated hours to someone who does it all day long.</li>
<li>Filip Okay?</li>
<li>Filip So I think that way.</li>
<li>Filip I'm using my hours effectively.</li>
<li>So either I can get it done, or I'm going to get somebody Filip who can get it done for us.</li>
<li>Filip and I won't.</li>
<li>I won't distract myself with with the connector.</li>
<li>Is it that you want to use the connector strictly within Filip Qlik Sense applications?</li>
<li>Or is it that you're using the connector in external applications or pipelines that you're building?</li>
<li>Filip I was trying to use it in Qlik Sense.</li>
<li>I was trying to connect to ServiceNow, and I was trying to pull in some data Filip directly from ServiceNow.</li>
<li>Filip and it didn't work with the normal approach, and then I was by support I was told that I should be using.</li>
<li>I should try at least to use the Api calls.</li>
<li>Filip and I tried and seemed like some of the tables were were being uploaded, but some of them were problematic, and I'm not sure why it's happening.</li>
<li>Maybe it's Filip it might be our data.</li>
<li>Filip But if it is, I also would want to understand how we can handle things like that.</li>
<li>Filip Yeah, absolutely.</li>
<li>I I doubt it's and well, who knows we.</li>
<li>Filip So I feel like we've done a with your help.</li>
<li>I think we've done a nice job with covering off on everything the visuals.</li>
<li>Filip Those are really just a function of.</li>
<li>If we have everything else defined.</li>
<li>Filip we can just decide.</li>
<li>So I think we've covered all of that Filip and I I feel like you've over the course of this conversation.</li>
<li>You've covered Filip the project, timeline.</li>
<li>Would would that Filip would that be correct?</li>
<li>If you like, handle on what you want.</li>
<li>One thing I'm going to disadvantage of is my colleagues.</li>
<li>Qlik, colleagues have sent me some screenshots of some really excellently Filip documented measure.</li>
<li>Definitions and things are those part of something that you put together for this particular effort.</li>
<li>It is.</li>
<li>Yes, that's probably from the documents that I'm going to send to you.</li>
<li>Okay.</li>
<li>Filip alright.</li>
<li>And those would be associated with the booking booking data.</li>
<li>Filip Okay.</li>
<li>Filip that's great.</li>
<li>So Filip what I'll do is when we've completed this call Filip I'll receive those and and go through those.</li>
<li>Filip And again, it's like a 99% of the instances.</li>
<li>I never get that level of documentation.</li>
<li>So it's Filip it's great.</li>
<li>Filip Is there?</li>
<li>Are there any other materials or things like that that Filip I'm going to be able to review, or that you want me Filip to have access to.</li>
<li>Filip for now we only have this document.</li>
<li>That's is is prepared by Amal.</li>
<li>So he prepared this, based on Filip his knowledge how it could be prepared.</li>
<li>I reviewed it with him, and the level of details that is included here.</li>
<li>We we suppose that it is enough, but if it wouldn't, we would want to also understand Filip what kind of level of details would you need to to move on and to understand that the end goal, because it might not be everything.</li>
<li>But this is the only document that we have, because the used cases is not that big.</li>
<li>So we didn't prepare anything else.</li>
<li>Filip Okay, no, I'll I'll Filip review it.</li>
<li>And again, I rarely.</li>
<li>Filip I rarely have anything written.</li>
<li>I rarely receive anything that has been written down.</li>
<li>Filip Or at least, you know it's handwritten.</li>
<li>I'm glad that I'm doing great job.</li>
<li>Yes, I mean it does.</li>
<li>It sounds like I'm just sucking up to you.</li>
<li>But no, this is.</li>
<li>Filip you guys seem to really have your ducks in a row, so I'm glad.</li>
<li>All right.</li>
<li>So, knowing that then I have access to the in in terms of the tenant that I have access to.</li>
<li>Filip I'll share my screen here.</li>
<li>And let's just make sure.</li>
<li>Filip See if I have anything Filip that I can drive around to?</li>
<li>Filip so just please let me know if you're able to see my screen.</li>
<li>See it.</li>
<li>Okay.</li>
<li>Filip so Filip is there anything Filip you don't see anything?</li>
<li>Okay.</li>
<li>Filip let me go to catalog and see.</li>
<li>Filip So I would have to add you to the groups that okay, I know what I have to do.</li>
<li>I'll add you to the groups.</li>
<li>And Filip do you have 5 min, or just like, Oh, absolutely.</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>I'm your.</li>
<li>I'm all yours Filip for for better or for worse, I'm all yours.</li>
<li>Filip So spaces, I think that's spaces.</li>
<li>Filip I was logged out one sec.</li>
<li>Filip Yeah, if if possible.</li>
<li>And pardon me for talking while you're trying to get stuff done there, but the best for me is to either have root, admin access, or Filip it can walk you through the others so that I can Filip be it the admin admin, console, and things like that.</li>
<li>Filip Add member Filip and since I'm a like, I'm an insufferable talker while you're Filip While you're doing that, D, does Perkona have access to Qlik training?</li>
<li>Is that something?</li>
<li>Filip Because that's helpful for me to know?</li>
<li>Filip I think we do, and we, me and Amal, we will attend Filip a training Filip additional training for the visualizations Filip like the like.</li>
<li>The Filip someone will lead it.</li>
<li>I think that's Filip it's like a virtual session for our for 2 days that we will have with Amal.</li>
<li>Filip Okay, so that's it you have in person, whether it's virtual or not, it's in person training.</li>
<li>Filip Yes, yes.</li>
<li>Filip okay.</li>
<li>So I'll find out if you have.</li>
<li>Filip I don't know if you're able to see my screen.</li>
<li>This is Filip it's called Qlik Filip continuous classroom.</li>
<li>Exactly.</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>I saw this.</li>
<li>Do you have access to this?</li>
<li>Filip Yes.</li>
<li>Oh, great.</li>
<li>Okay.</li>
<li>So among the things we can do.</li>
<li>It'll be.</li>
<li>Filip you know, very easy is, we can also Filip put together a curriculum for your new users to take advantage of this, because this training really is excellent.</li>
<li>It has.</li>
<li>Filip Not only is it very bite size in terms of video instruction, but it comes with Filip quite a bit of sample data, Filip applications that mirror the content that's been reviewed during the Filip the lessons and things like that.</li>
<li>Filip That's exactly what I would want to do with you at the end, when we will be done with 2 main goals.</li>
<li>I would want to go through this and just collect like the like.</li>
<li>You said the curriculum for the new users that will come in and Filip we'll we will just address the learning curve here.</li>
<li>Filip Okay, great.</li>
<li>So no matter what we get done in the 1st week.</li>
<li>Filip As long as we carve out 2 or 3 h Filip we'll be able to at a minimum put together Filip roadmaps if you will, for the different user.</li>
<li>User segments for for your tenant.</li>
<li>Filip Great.</li>
<li>Okay.</li>
<li>Users.</li>
<li>Filip Alright to the instance.</li>
<li>You should see something more now, maybe.</li>
<li>Okay.</li>
<li>Filip Great.</li>
<li>Okay, thanks.</li>
<li>Filip The bookings is Filip the one.</li>
<li>Filip Probably this one is Filip right.</li>
<li>Filip And alright.</li>
<li>So what a Filip what?</li>
<li>I'm gonna be able if you don't mind, I'm gonna go back.</li>
<li>What I want to be able to do is look at the data model.</li>
<li>So I can see what I have.</li>
<li>Filip so you're probably missing some Filip privileges right?</li>
<li>Filip What I what should I do to give you like Filip higher level access, which which privileges should I set?</li>
<li>Filip I will take a look for you in just a second.</li>
<li>Let me just do so.</li>
<li>I want to go to the data load, editor.</li>
<li>Filip and this is the main things I want to make sure I have access to whatever data connections you want me to have Filip access to.</li>
<li>Filip So I have Salesforce.</li>
<li>But I don't have service.</li>
<li>Now.</li>
<li>Filip let's see, yeah, ServiceNow does exist, because it's it's not here.</li>
<li>Filip I'll add you to the second group.</li>
<li>Yeah, that's right.</li>
<li>Filip And then, if you don't mind, we can.</li>
<li>Also, we can walk through.</li>
<li>And so now we'll have a video of it.</li>
<li>Filip just just specifically what the issue is.</li>
<li>And that way.</li>
<li>Filip if if I don't think I can solve it for you in a timely manner.</li>
<li>Filip I'll pull in someone who can, and I can have them watch that section of the video.</li>
<li>So you don't have to go over it again.</li>
<li>Filip Okay, I think we should see it.</li>
<li>Filip ken.</li>
<li>Filip Well, it's it's not in this Filip application.</li>
<li>It's okay.</li>
<li>Filip right business services.</li>
<li>That should be it.</li>
<li>Filip It doesn't show up.</li>
<li>Oh, yeah.</li>
<li>So I understand.</li>
<li>I get it.</li>
<li>So it's not in there.</li>
<li>Let's see if I'm Filip I see.</li>
<li>And this is how you where you were encountering an issue.</li>
<li>Right?</li>
<li>It's just at this, the create connection.</li>
<li>Filip Yes, this didn't work.</li>
<li>And then.</li>
<li>Filip within the one of the applications.</li>
<li>I have a data load script where I, Filip where I started manipulating the data script, the the load script.</li>
<li>And there I was able to identify what was the problem with which table?</li>
<li>Filip And but I I not sure.</li>
<li>Why?</li>
<li>Filip Okay, well, would you?</li>
<li>How about we?</li>
<li>I turn the you can share your screen.</li>
<li>We'll go into that application and take a look.</li>
<li>Filip Eric.</li>
<li>Filip okay, great Filip right?</li>
<li>And is that in terms of Filip data connection?</li>
<li>So I have Filip business services Filip and finance, and so do I have what I need.</li>
<li>So we have Salesforce bulk.</li>
<li>Filip Are there?</li>
<li>Are there any other Filip sources of data like, for instance, for booking data or Salesforce, where the booking data is.</li>
<li>Filip Salesforce is where the booking data is.</li>
<li>Filip and ServiceNow is going to be used for a different purpose.</li>
<li>There will be another application that we will probably join with the Salesforce data.</li>
<li>But for now we are just trying to make the connection for ServiceNow.</li>
<li>Arthur Okay, just for my own reference.</li>
<li>And Arthur to ensure I'm using the same business language and business terms that you are, what is Percona's specific use of the ServiceNow platform that generates the data being used by this Qlik Sense dashboard application?</li>
<li>Is the data associated with Customer Service by Percona for its customers?</li>
<li>Filip I can share my screen.</li>
<li>Okay?</li>
<li>Arthur Oh, that'd be great.</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>Let me stop sharing my screen here.</li>
<li>Arthur I'm not sure how to end my screen sharing.</li>
<li>Oh, there you go, you're now sharing your screen.</li>
<li>Thank you.</li>
<li>Filip Right?</li>
<li>So my screen is showing the Percona Qlik Cloud Analytics Home page.</li>
<li>The applications visible on the page I'm currently sharing will be connecting to Percona's Jira system.</li>
<li>I didn't have a lot of problems with the Qlik Jira Data Connector, so for now there will be some things that I might ask you for assistance later on.</li>
<li>Filip On my screen now is the Booking Data Dashboard, the application that is using the Qlik Salesforce Data Connector.</li>
<li>Filip And on my screen now we have the 'ETR (Entitlement, Time, Review) Synchronization Quality Assurance Dashboard'.</li>
<li>The 'ETR' Dashboard uses two Qlik Data the Qlik Salesforce Data Connector and the Qlik ServiceNow Data Connector.</li>
<li>Arthur Okay, thank you for showing me these dashboards.</li>
<li>Filip And here on my screen Filip is the Data Load Script Editor from the 'ETR' Dashboard in which I'm Filip attempting to load data from Percona's ServiceNow application.</li>
<li>Filip Right, and this is the Data Load Editor Sheet in which I'm using the Qlik ServiceNow Data Connector.</li>
<li>Filip And when I attempt to run a reload of this application Filip an error related to the Qlik ServiceNow Data Connector is thrown and the reload fails.</li>
<li>Arthur Thank you for the explanation.</li>
<li>I'll get a screenshot just as soon as the Error Message Arthur pops up on your screen.</li>
<li>Arthur And I'm sorry for having to ask, but what does the 'ETR' stand for in the name of Percona's ETR Dashboard?</li>
<li>Filip 'ETR' stands for Entitlement Time Review Arthur Thank you.</li>
<li>Arthur Can you please explain the meaning of 'Entitlement Time Review'?</li>
<li>Filip So that is something that we are using as a concept that our Services Department, like Managed Services, are selling block of hours Filip to our customers and the Service Entitlement for the hours that each customer can use Filip is what we are calling an Entitlement.</li>
<li>Filip Now, this is something that is generated, based on the contract in Salesforce, and we are moving this information to Percona's ServiceNow system, and ServiceNow controls Filip the amount of hours that is being utilized by specific customers.</li>
<li>Filip And then the 'Entitlement Time Review' refers to a report that is telling us Filip how many hours each customer used Filip for a particular month.</li>
<li>Arthur Alright understood.</li>
<li>Thank you.</li>
<li>That's really super helpful.</li>
<li>Arthur May I please step away for 15 seconds?</li>
<li>I'm gonna leave my microphone on.</li>
<li>I'm just going to give my dog, Sadie, a treat so that she Arthur leaves me in peace here.</li>
<li>Arthur Alright, Sadie?</li>
<li>Good job!</li>
<li>Here you go, here's a treat for you!</li>
<li>Arthur That's right, Sadie!</li>
<li>Good show.</li>
<li>Arthur Alright, Sadie.</li>
<li>Let's go!</li>
<li>Arthur Okay, alright, thank you.</li>
<li>I appreciate your patience, Filip.</li>
<li>We can get back to reviewing your attempt to reload your Qlik Sense application's Data Load Editor script.</li>
<li>Arthur Alright.</li>
<li>I'm not going to get excited that your application's reload process hasn't failed yet.</li>
<li>I'm assuming the failure doesn't come until later in the reload process?</li>
<li>Filip Exactly.</li>
<li>Filip I'm not sure where which table it was, I think.</li>
<li>Oh, that's seems like Filip Salesforce already.</li>
<li>Arthur Well, it's helpful to know what is working as well.</li>
<li>So, has it hit the Error?</li>
<li>Filip No.</li>
<li>Arthur Is this the same Error Message that you received before?</li>
<li>Filip No, no, I it's a different thing.</li>
<li>Filip I think.</li>
<li>I removed the problematic line, the problematic table from the service.</li>
<li>Now, Connector, just to see if the rest will be loading fine.</li>
<li>Filip I'll have to add this back.</li>
<li>I think this was problem with task table.</li>
<li>And even though we didn't Filip specify particular Filip fields that we would want to ingest like we wanted to, ingest only the 'Id' field Filip and some other specific fields.</li>
<li>And the problem with the ingestion was in fields that were not selected by us.</li>
<li>Filip And that's something that I don't understand.</li>
<li>Arthur Okay, yeah, that sounds like something we may want to address somewhere within the scope of this Engagement.</li>
<li>Filip Great, that sounds like it should be.</li>
<li>Arthur It sounds Arthur complex enough that I wanna yeah dive into that a bit more.</li>
<li>I I would want to say quickly, though with that circular reference.</li>
<li>I think it Arthur perhaps one of the Arthur one of the elements we'll include in terms of for the back end and best practices will be Arthur optimizing Arthur the Data Models that are built Arthur to support the front end Qlik Sense application development (i.e.</li>
<li>User Interface Design).</li>
<li>Arthur So, for instance, if we Arthur if you're able to.</li>
<li>Arthur Instead of the Data Load Editor selection, in the upper left, if we just click the dropdown near there and let's just go to the Data Model Viewer, please.</li>
<li>Arthur And this is also part of I'm ignorant of your background.</li>
<li>Do you have a background in Filip like relational database design or anything like that.</li>
<li>Oh, yes, in in a lot of things I have background in programming Filip are in zoom.</li>
<li>Arthur So it sounds like, yeah, here this is, you're early in the process of all of your Arthur testing and development and things.</li>
<li>So this this kind of Arthur so we'll work to make sure, because the same rules would apply Arthur in building a Qlik Data Model as it would with.</li>
<li>Arthur you know, any type of relational model where you want it to be a dimensional model, Arthur a Star Schema, or a Snowflake Schema will generally be the most performant for modeling data in Qlik.</li>
<li>Arthur And there are other data modeling techniques, depending on the data volumes and other factors.</li>
<li>Arthur And there are other, you know, techniques or practices.</li>
<li>Arthur Yeah, I'm assuming here, we're you're just.</li>
<li>Arthur You're just trying to validate that the connections are working correctly.</li>
<li>Is that accurate?</li>
<li>Filip Exactly.</li>
<li>I was trying to Filip reflect the Filip the query Filip that's I'm using in a different system, currently, because we also have a Metabase.</li>
<li>We have this kind of dashboard Filip and I was trying to move it to Qlik.</li>
<li>But I that's the problem that I faced.</li>
<li>Filip I'm not this.</li>
<li>This Filip is probably not something that should exist.</li>
<li>Filip but it is something that is necessary for us to understand this, because Filip there are Filip in.</li>
<li>I would have to show you the relevant query Filip in the Metabase.</li>
<li>So you can understand, what are we trying to achieve?</li>
<li>Filip It would be easier Filip to do it this way.</li>
<li>Filip Let's maybe we do that in Filip in on, you know.</li>
<li>Say, tomorrow or Wednesday I will prepare myself for it.</li>
<li>I'll I can prepare a document like this Filip where you will have all details what we would want to do with the ETR Dashboard.</li>
<li>Filip And then Filip we could go through this when I'm going to be ready for now, I don't think it would be waste of your time.</li>
<li>Arthur Yeah, agreed.</li>
<li>I think it's we can be more productive.</li>
<li>I can also just show you some techniques that are specific to Qlik in terms of how to overcome Circular Reference issues, like that one.</li>
<li>Filip Understood that the data requires.</li>
<li>You know that.</li>
<li>And Filip that's the only way.</li>
<li>It is possible that I'm just not Filip importing the data in the right way, because maybe we don't really need this Filip relations here.</li>
<li>And I could just import whole tables and just do the manipulation of the data in a different place.</li>
<li>Filip I agree it depending on.</li>
<li>And I think it is situated.</li>
<li>Arthur It's situationally dependent.</li>
<li>And so sure let's put this on the parking lot, and we can.</li>
<li>You and I can go through this.</li>
<li>I'll better understand it.</li>
<li>And but Filip if you could.</li>
<li>Filip exactly, if you could modify this application to put back in Arthur the lines that are generating the able error.</li>
<li>Yes, I will do.</li>
<li>That would be great, and what I'll do is I'll run it.</li>
<li>I'll get that error.</li>
<li>Arthur and then Arthur I'll just let you know quickly Arthur whether I can Arthur address it or I'll get someone to help me.</li>
<li>Arthur And just so you're, Arthur so we're clear.</li>
<li>It's, you know, if I get someone to help me, the hours that would be required would then be carved out of whatever time we have, so it wouldn't be.</li>
<li>Arthur Someone is coming in.</li>
<li>And then.</li>
<li>Arthur you know, trying to impose new hours.</li>
<li>It's just Arthur I may delegate this just so I can stay focused on Arthur other pieces.</li>
<li>Filip Sounds great.</li>
<li>Yeah, good.</li>
<li>Alright.</li>
<li>Alright.</li>
<li>So what I'd like to do is when it's convenient.</li>
<li>Filip if you can.</li>
<li>Arthur I guess both.</li>
<li>If I'm able to have the video is less important.</li>
<li>The transcript would be very important to me.</li>
<li>Arthur and then I'll go through that Arthur and over the next day I'm going to put together Arthur a work plan based on what we've shared.</li>
<li>Arthur I would say this did Arthur I think meeting at least once a day.</li>
<li>Arthur because this is such a short amount of time, it's going to be important.</li>
<li>Arthur So I think, at the at a minimum.</li>
<li>Arthur Well, I guess what would work for you every day this week Arthur for meeting?</li>
<li>It doesn't have to be very long in terms of just every day we do a touch base Filip Every weekday morning this week at 00 a.m.</li>
<li>ET is a convenient time for me.</li>
<li>Arthur Perfect.</li>
<li>Okay.</li>
<li>Arthur Yeah.</li>
<li>So if Arthur half an hour, probably.</li>
<li>Yeah, it can be.</li>
<li>Yes, we can use it as a stand up.</li>
<li>And then if we decide, for instance, Arthur we need to do a different meeting, for instance, to review what we just talked about, Arthur then we don't need to do the scheduled daily 00 a.m.</li>
<li>ET meeting that particular day.</li>
<li>Because I just anticipate Arthur that.</li>
<li>I just want to make sure we're touching base every day.</li>
<li>But let's yes, we'll see how we will do Arthur with the, with the booking data, because that's the most important thing.</li>
<li>I will invite Amal to those meetings, so he will be able to explain you any details that you might have questions about regarding the booking data.</li>
<li>Filip and we'll see how it will go regarding the development.</li>
<li>And if that's going to be necessary.</li>
<li>We can have these those meetings, and if not.</li>
<li>Filip I'm not.</li>
<li>I don't know if you think it is necessary, we can meet.</li>
<li>Filip Okay.</li>
<li>So one of our one of our Filip needs is also something like cooperation with you.</li>
<li>So we will also understand.</li>
<li>Filip How are you going to do this?</li>
<li>And maybe Filip every day.</li>
<li>Maybe that's a good idea.</li>
<li>You would Filip show us.</li>
<li>Filip How did you do stuff that that was done so we can also learn while you will be doing things.</li>
<li>Arthur Yeah, absolutely.</li>
<li>Yeah.</li>
<li>I think that's a great way to go as I'm looking now.</li>
<li>I just opened up the Salesforce Data Connection.</li>
<li>I'm looking at the tables and things.</li>
<li>Arthur Do I have access the applications I have access to?</li>
<li>Will it be clear if the applications as well as the document you're gonna provide me?</li>
<li>Will that give me what I need to get up to speed with the particular tables I need to be working with?</li>
<li>Arthur Or are all of the data I need to understand imported into the Booking Data Dashboard?</li>
<li>Filip Everything that's needed to prepare the reports Filip are based on the document Filip that I'm going to share with you.</li>
<li>This is.</li>
<li>Filip I prepared this data set based on the Filip export Filip to spreadsheet that we are getting from Salesforce.</li>
<li>So every data point that was in that spreadsheet is currently available in Filip Qlik.</li>
<li>And the document that you will receive from me is referring to those fields which are available in the Filip Booking Data Dashboard Qlik Sense application.</li>
<li>Arthur Okay, alright.</li>
<li>Great.</li>
<li>Okay.</li>
<li>And I'm looking at the Booking Data Dashboard and I see, Arthur on the 'Dev dashboard' Sheet, Arthur eight KPI Visualization Objects.</li>
<li>Filip Exactly.</li>
<li>Those are the numbers that I was trying to compare with a similar report from Salesforce.</li>
<li>Filip and we need to be perfectly sure Filip that there are no discrepancies between the data displayed in Percona's Salesforce system and the data displayed in Percona's Qlik Cloud Platform.</li>
<li>So Filip we must also be able every day to show you the numbers that we see in Percona's Salesforce system Filip and be able to tie out those numbers with the Filip Qlik Cloud Platform data.</li>
<li>Filip Currently, I am not able to achieve a 100% Filip validation of the data from the Salesforce and Qlik systems.</li>
<li>There are some issues that we are aware about, like Currency Conversion Rates for the exchange for the various currency types contained in the Salesforce operational data tables, Filip and probably some more issues.</li>
<li>But that's something that Amal will be able to explain more.</li>
<li>And but all of the things that Filip should have been applied to this data set are in the document Filip that I will send you after this call.</li>
<li>Arthur Right.</li>
<li>Arthur So good.</li>
<li>So what I'll do Arthur will be, you know.</li>
<li>Take the transcript.</li>
<li>I'll use that to assist me with Arthur putting together a work plan and deliverables which we can go over tomorrow morning.</li>
<li>Arthur I'm gonna go through the Booking Data Dashboard application along with the document you'll send me Arthur to understand the Measures used in the Qlik Sense Booking Data Dashboard application.</li>
<li>Arthur And so would part of what you want to accomplish during this first week, or 'Phase One' objectives be for me to focus on the Booking Data Dashboard Qlik Sense application and Arthur work with you to lay out Arthur a few Sheets populated with relevant Data Visualizations populated with the Measures contained in the document you're sending me?</li>
<li>Filip Yes, with a lot more than me.</li>
<li>But yes, exactly.</li>
<li>Arthur Alright.</li>
<li>And we know that with the Booking Data Dashboard, you're having issues with getting the data to tie out correctly Filip and Arthur and the thought.</li>
<li>Arthur So I think that's another one.</li>
<li>And maybe that's during the session with them all is we can uncover.</li>
<li>He can identify for me Arthur which Arthur which data, elements or measures aren't tying out Arthur with the Salesforce database.</li>
<li>And then we can dig into that issue.</li>
<li>Filip Yes, I'm sure she will be able to point that out.</li>
<li>We will be both on the call, so we will definitely be able to guide you, and we will find that.</li>
<li>But Filip I'm not able Filip to say what exactly is, is wrong with that.</li>
<li>At this point we will have to try.</li>
<li>The currencies will have to try Filip to make sure that the scope of the of the range of the dates is correct.</li>
<li>Filip If, yeah, there are couple of filters that are applied on the Salesforce side that I'm not sure if I was applying correctly in Qlik.</li>
<li>Arthur Understood.</li>
<li>When could you, Amal and I have an hour to have that meeting?</li>
<li>Could we do that by the end of the day tomorrow, Tuesday, July 16, 2024?</li>
<li>Filip Most probably by the end of the day I'm not going to be available, because that's going to be very late for me.</li>
<li>I'm based in Poland.</li>
<li>Arthur Oh, when I say end of day, I'm sorry.</li>
<li>So could we, would it be possible to do tomorrow morning?</li>
<li>Filip I'll have like an hour or 2 Filip till end of my day.</li>
<li>So that's Filip since I will have a call at Filip 30 a.m.</li>
<li>ET Filip for an hour, or maybe not an hour.</li>
<li>But that's like a team call.</li>
<li>So I need to be there, sure I'm out will be free.</li>
<li>So he will still be able to help you if you'll be available.</li>
<li>Arthur Yeah.</li>
<li>And thank you first of all, pardon me for being ignorant about where you're located.</li>
<li>Arthur 1st of all, just cause I'll be very happy to.</li>
<li>But secondly, just because this is a short duration.</li>
<li>There's no problem with me taking an earlier call.</li>
<li>If that gives you more breathing room.</li>
<li>If you want to talk at 7 am Eastern and that makes your life easier.</li>
<li>That's great with me.</li>
<li>It's no problem.</li>
<li>Filip Yeah.</li>
<li>So that's fine with me.</li>
<li>But Amal is on the West coast?</li>
<li>I think so.</li>
<li>Alright.</li>
<li>So yeah, I think if Amal is the priority in terms of this particular piece, the Booking Data Dashboard.</li>
<li>Arthur Then I would say, as soon as it's convenient for him.</li>
<li>I'd like to get that done before the end of the day tomorrow.</li>
<li>Filip Let's.</li>
<li>I will try to get him on a call Filip tomorrow.</li>
<li>Filip and Filip we will get together.</li>
<li>We will meet each other, and you will be able to reach out to him at any time, and you will be able to agree anytime to work with him, because I'm not going to be needed for all the sessions.</li>
<li>Okay, will be more interested.</li>
<li>And looking at the visualizations, and we'll be able to provide a lot more information about the booking data and requirements for the visualizations.</li>
<li>How Filip he would want to Filip see the Filip slideshow source.</li>
<li>Also how to say it.</li>
<li>Or if he was using a specific word.</li>
<li>Filip Okay.</li>
<li>Filip like a Filip Storytelling.</li>
<li>Exactly.</li>
<li>So.</li>
<li>He would want to have this kind of Storytelling possibility with couple of Filip dashboards that will be going from a high level Filip details to lower level details with some Filip with some dig ins into the details for particular Filip in Filip visualization.</li>
<li>So he will be able to explain all that.</li>
<li>Arthur Okay, yeah, that's perfect.</li>
<li>And then I'm glad we have a chance to confirm that.</li>
<li>So you feel free Arthur to.</li>
<li>Just if you want to move Arthur to the time that we spend, whether it's the daily touching base or meetings where we're getting more into detail, feel free to move those earlier.</li>
<li>Arthur Okay, yeah, so yeah, just Arthur just so, you know, let's okay.</li>
<li>So that sounds great.</li>
<li>So that's with them all for the booking dashboards.</li>
<li>Arthur The service.</li>
<li>Now, Connector.</li>
<li>Once I hear from you, I'll know that Arthur I can go into the ETR Dashboard Application, replicate that error on my own.</li>
<li>Arthur and then decide whether I handle it or I pass that off.</li>
<li>Arthur I delegate that so that it can be done more efficiently.</li>
<li>Arthur and I feel comfortable that we're on the same page in terms of Arthur that 3rd piece, the training piece.</li>
<li>Arthur Alright, so say when we meet tomorrow morning I'll have that outline Arthur for how we want to accomplish, you know, how we want to spend the entire eighty billable hours allocated for this engagement.</li>
<li>Arthur And Arthur I'll rely on you in terms of Arthur the, for instance, what we had looked at just a moment ago before, issues with data models, Arthur the circular reference and things.</li>
<li>Arthur If that's something that specific, either we use it as a used case for Arthur best practices, or it's something that has to be Arthur resolved in Phase One or Phase Two of the engagement.</li>
<li>Arthur We can go over that as soon as it's convenient for you as well.</li>
<li>Filip Sounds great.</li>
<li>I just sent you an invite.</li>
<li>Filip or the 9 A. M. Filip Sync.</li>
<li>Daily Sync.</li>
<li>Filip I invited Amal there.</li>
<li>Filip and tomorrow we'll discuss any details when Amal will be available to work with you on the details regarding the Booking Data Dashboard.</li>
<li>Filip We can start there.</li>
<li>Arthur That's perfect, much appreciated.</li>
<li>Filip And for tomorrow I'll be ready with the ETR Dashboard problems and the ServiceNow Filip synchronization issues.</li>
<li>So I'll send you the details, and you will be able to pass it over to someone else.</li>
<li>Arthur All right, that's terrific, and is no, no one else has assisted you.</li>
<li>It sounds like, perhaps you had contacted Qlik support.</li>
<li>Filip Yes, I can share with you the case that was raised by me.</li>
<li>Arthur Yes, please, because, yeah, if you didn't get your problem solved, that's not Arthur how it's supposed to work.</li>
<li>So yes, please do.</li>
<li>And then we'll be ready to address it.</li>
<li>Arthur We can at least go over tomorrow, and I'll let you know whether I'll do it or someone else will get it done.</li>
<li>Filip Alright.</li>
<li>Thank you.</li>
<li>Alright.</li>
<li>Thank you so much.</li>
<li>I hope you have a nice evening.</li>
<li>Arthur Thank you.</li>
<li>All right.</li>
<li>Talk to you tomorrow.</li>
<li>Filip Till tomorrow, bye.</li>
