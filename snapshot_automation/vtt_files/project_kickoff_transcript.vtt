1
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.230
Franklin Dorsey: And it's recording alright perfect.

2
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.840
Bob Jones: Yeah. So we'll take this transcript, having covered each of those elements.

3
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.590
Bob Jones: And then my plan is just to

4
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.560
Bob Jones: use Quiznos Analytics Answers to

5
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.580
Bob Jones: make our lives easier, to generate

6
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.930
Bob Jones: a draft document that

7
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.579
Bob Jones: well, then, we can just touch it up over the course of the 2 weeks, and at the end.

8
00:00:39.626 --> 00:00:41.770
Franklin Dorsey: That sounds great.

9
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:57.778
Bob Jones: Yeah, so good. All right. I would love unless you're would you rather go through the questions first, or do you want to go through your project plan? First, let's go through the questions. Let's get the formalities first. Okay? Sounds good. Let me.

10
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.330
Bob Jones: I'm gonna pull up my

11
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.919
Bob Jones: email just to go through each of the

12
00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.560
Bob Jones: individual questions.

13
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.400
Bob Jones: Okay, great. So

14
00:01:12.917 --> 00:01:25.000
Bob Jones: we'll just go through them in in turn. So the first question is the Company Name. Is Quest Enterprises the entire company name, or is it Quest Enterprises Inc. or is there a different name? The next question is Company Industry.

15
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.540
Bob Jones: What is Quest Enterprises's Industry?

16
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.189
Franklin Dorsey: It's databases services.

17
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.670
Bob Jones: Okay, thanks. I was not familiar with Quest Enterprises, but

18
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.280
Bob Jones: now I am, and I'm glad to know

19
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:49.589
Bob Jones: The next question is Company Location. Where is Quest Enterprises located?

20
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.885
Franklin Dorsey: The Quest Enterprises company headquarters is located in Raleigh, North Carolina, United States.

21
00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:09.410
Bob Jones: Okay. And the next question is Company Contact. I'm assuming you and I will be working together, and that you, Franklin Dorsey, are the Company Contact. The next question is the Company Contact Role.
22
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.579
Franklin Dorsey: Yes, I am the correct person to list as the Company Contact.

23
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.509
Franklin Dorsey: My title is Senior Business Systems Analyst, and my title should be listed as the Company Contact Role.

24
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:30.539
Bob Jones: Alright, thank you, Filip. Let's begin discussing the purpose of this project we're here today to kick off? What activities will Quiznos Analytics Professional Services be performing and what deliverables will Quiznos Analytics Professional Services be delivering for Quest Enterprises during the course of this project?

25
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.959
Franklin Dorsey: Okay, so

26
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.979
Franklin Dorsey: our plan is to get data and analytics

27
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.669
Franklin Dorsey: adopted in Quest Enterprises because we are really struggling with it.

28
00:02:41.784 --> 00:02:47.469
Franklin Dorsey: The plan is to make the data and analytics like Business Intelligence tool and

29
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.460
Franklin Dorsey: data literacy data cataloging more

30
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.290
Franklin Dorsey: available and approachable

31
00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:02.830
Franklin Dorsey: for the entire company. Quest Enterprises will start small. There will be just few people that will be starting with Quiznos Analytics

32
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.850
Franklin Dorsey: to use it, and then we will propagate the knowledge

33
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.500
Franklin Dorsey: to a wider audience.

34
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.470
Franklin Dorsey: 1st of all, we will want to create some trainings

35
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.990
Franklin Dorsey: based on your experience based on Quiznos Analytics's

36
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.120
Franklin Dorsey: learning resources.

37
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.310
Franklin Dorsey: That's what we will want to bring to Quest Enterprises

38
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.359
Franklin Dorsey: with this Quiznos Analytics Professional Services engagement.

39
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.080
Franklin Dorsey: And the

40
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.119
Franklin Dorsey: deliverables that we are thinking, like the measurable things that we want to get out of this Professional Services engagement

41
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:46.700
Franklin Dorsey: are, first off, the Booking Data Dashboard that will be available for the Quest Enterprises Finance Team. Secondly, the Quest Enterprises Revenue Operations Team, as well as the wider audience

42
00:03:48.086 --> 00:03:53.364
Franklin Dorsey: connected to Quest Enterprises's ServiceNow data. I am having a problem with the Quiznos Analytics ServiceNow Data Connector. The

43
00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:05.030
Franklin Dorsey: out-of-the-box Quiznos Analytics ServiceNow Data Connector doesn't work properly, and I'm struggling with the API. So that's the second thing. And the third thing is Training Materials. Preparation of Training Materials is the third

44
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.840
Franklin Dorsey: goal, together with the

45
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.300
Franklin Dorsey: with Data Catalog preparation. So,

46
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.250
Franklin Dorsey: we want to have a set of information for new users that will be

47
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:35.380
Franklin Dorsey: joining Quest Enterprises's Quiznos Analytics Cloud Platform and will be able to use the tool, and we want to address them with the Training Materials first, and then we would want to provide them access to some type of Data Catalog, so they will be able to see what kind of data sets do they have, what kind of data is in those data sets, and what kinds of

48
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.300
Franklin Dorsey: Data Visualizations or Quiznos Analytics Dashboards we already have.

49
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:47.029
Franklin Dorsey: This kind of stuff is the 3rd goal and is the least important at this point, but I would want to address it, also, if we'll have time.

50
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:54.830
Bob Jones: Okay, thank you. Yeah. In 99% of my

51
00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:07.130
Bob Jones: experiences with engagements of this kind, no one is able to articulate as clearly as you just did what they want to get out of the engagement. So this is terrific, and I embrace your third point

52
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:15.440
Bob Jones: because it's soon enough that the first two priorities will be met, and then ongoing you'll be left with needing to meet your third priority of how to onboard

53
00:05:16.145 --> 00:05:21.050
Bob Jones: new users to the Quiznos Analytics Cloud Platform, as well as foster their productive use of the platform. So,

54
00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:25.014
Bob Jones: what we can do over the next day is

55
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.100
Bob Jones: brainstorm and

56
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:35.710
Bob Jones: scope out what we need to get done, and then prioritize those items and identify what we can actually get done within this engagement's allowable time. So at a minimum for the third point,

57
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:42.030
Bob Jones: you and I can work together to make sure that we at least have a framework, if not,

58
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:49.310
Bob Jones: you know, specific deliverables for that 3rd objective of Training, Onboarding, and those kinds of activities.

59
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.480
Franklin Dorsey: Excellent.

60
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:51.580
Bob Jones: Okay.

61
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.639
Bob Jones: Yeah, Training, Onboarding, and those kinds of activities have been a real interest of mine over the last few years.

62
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.462
Bob Jones: I digress a bit here, but

63
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.170
Bob Jones: how do you put

64
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.710
Bob Jones: that type of

65
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.903
Bob Jones: resource into a in a digestible

66
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.352
Bob Jones: medium, so that people actually use it, you know.

67
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.560
Bob Jones: So yeah. So I'm glad to have that third point be a part of this engagement.

68
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.219
Bob Jones: Okay, that was terrific. And

69
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.100
Bob Jones: all right. So let's talk about the solution. Some of these points. Clearly, we won't

70
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:34.649
Bob Jones: be, or I won't, because you won't have to draft any of this, but I'll be grateful for your oversight and

71
00:06:35.281 --> 00:06:39.699
Bob Jones: approval of the content.

72
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.480
Bob Jones: In terms of the solutions we deliver during this engagement, is Quest Enterprises on

73
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.110
Bob Jones: the Quiznos Analytics Windows Enterprise platform or the Quiznos Analytics Cloud platform?

74
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.690
Franklin Dorsey: Quest Enterprises is on the Quiznos Analytics Cloud platform.
75
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.729
Bob Jones: That's great. Okay, good. Is Quest Enterprises using any of the Quiznos Analytics Data Integration

76
00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:06.040
Bob Jones: components of the Quiznos Analytics Cloud platform? Or is this engagement focused entirely on Quiznos Analytics Cloud Analytics and Quiznos Analytics Sense application development? Because I did, thank you very much, get access right away to Quest Enterprises's Quiznos Analytics Cloud Tenant

77
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.840
Bob Jones: from the link you provided me. So this engagement will be focused on Quiznos Analytics Cloud Analytics and Quiznos Analytics Sense

78
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.259
Bob Jones: in terms of the tools and components we'll be using. Okay, yeah.

79
00:07:15.876 --> 00:07:36.470
Franklin Dorsey: Yes, Quiznos Analytics Sense. Well, Quiznos Analytics Cloud, I'm not sure of the naming of the specific Quiznos Analytics product that Quest Enterprises has licensed from Quiznos Analytics. But I think Quiznos Analytics Sense. But it's the Quiznos Analytics Cloud Platform version of Quiznos Analytics Sense, and we don't have any specific Quiznos Analytics product components or integrations added to Quest Enterprises's Quiznos Analytics Cloud Platform. I was recently talking with Quiznos Analytics Talenti Data Works about the Quiznos Analytics Cloud Data Integration products and capabilities, because Quest Enterprises is also looking at the Quiznos Analytics Cloud version of the Quiznos Analytics Data Integration Platform as an additional piece of the Quiznos Analytics Cloud Platform to license from Quiznos Analytics.

80
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.630
Franklin Dorsey: But Quest Enterprises hasn't made any decisions or affirmative steps around licensing any components of the Quiznos Analytics Data Integration Platform. So Quest Enterprises

81
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:49.750
Franklin Dorsey: just has the Quiznos Analytics Cloud instance that you got invited to log into as a user. Please let me know if you are missing any privileges to see something more, because we don't have much implemented in our Quiznos Analytics Cloud instance yet. If there would be something more that you need, just let me know, and I'll change it.

82
00:07:49.760 --> 00:08:05.999
Bob Jones: Oh, that's great. I appreciate that. So after we've ended this first meeting, I'll go drive around the Quest Enterprises Quiznos Analytics Cloud instance and take a look. I'm laughing because

83
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:13.290
Bob Jones: you can join the club in terms of confusion about Quiznos Analytics's product naming conventions. It's the same for me. Things

84
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:19.190
Bob Jones: things change so quickly. So you articulated it beautifully. So there's none of the Talenti Data Works Quiznos Analytics Data Integration

85
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:27.748
Bob Jones: components. And we're just gonna be working right on the Quest Enterprises Quiznos Analytics Cloud Tenant. So that's perfect.

86
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:34.999
Bob Jones: All right, and let me look at the next question, Product and Service Use. We've already talked about the Implementation Process question. So now let's

87
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:39.099
Bob Jones: discuss my activities and deliverables for next day or so. After I complete those activities and deliverables, we can plan to meet

88
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:42.150
Bob Jones: and we'll walk through what I think would be,

89
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:49.160
Bob Jones: I hope, an acceptable work plan and how we'll get things done for the duration of this current engagement.

90
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:52.959
Bob Jones: So that's the solution piece for now:

91
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:59.499
Bob Jones: the Engagement Outline document, as well as the details and timelines of this engagement. So we know, today's date, Monday, July 14, 2024 will be the answer to the 'Start Date' question.

92
00:08:59.886 --> 00:09:10.950
Bob Jones: And with this engagement budgeted for eighty hours, we know the answer to the 'End Date' question will be Friday, July 26, 2024. And the answers to some of these questions aren't set in stone. For instance, we have a set block of eighty billable hours.

93
00:09:11.418 --> 00:09:14.420
Bob Jones: My way of working is,

94
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:34.470
Bob Jones: you know, we'll make sure we get down on paper and agree very quickly about what we want to get done in the eighty hours of billable time. But if it takes a few hours extra here or there, that's irrelevant. It's not going to be, "I've burned through my allotted hours, and now I'll stop working" or something like that.

95
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:45.399
Bob Jones: To answer the 'Engagement Team' question, let's just list out the individuals from Quest Enterprises and Quiznos Analytics that we envision participating in this engagement, and also, for instance, any relevant Project Stakeholders.

96
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:52.149
Bob Jones: I know this isn't a very big project. But if there are other people that aren't direct members of the 'Engagement Team', like, for instance, Approvers or Steering Committee members, if you will.

97
00:09:52.230 --> 00:10:02.429
Bob Jones: Identifying those types of individuals will assist in answering the question about 'Milestones' because if those individuals need to be apprised over the course of this engagement, and you know what information we would need to provide them, we can create specific 'Milestones' to document those requirements.

98
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.209
Franklin Dorsey: Okay. So our plan was to

99
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:11.039
Franklin Dorsey: get the engagement with the Quiznos Analytics Professional Services Team, or you, Bob Jones, specifically

100
00:10:11.487 --> 00:10:25.409
Franklin Dorsey: for about a week and work with you on the most problematic things: the issue with the Quiznos Analytics ServiceNow Data Connector; the Quest Enterprises Booking Data Quiznos Analytics Sense application (i.e., Booking Data Dashboard), specifically the data and initial dashboard preparation based on the data that is already imported into Quest Enterprises's Quiznos Analytics Cloud platform.

101
00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:37.962
Franklin Dorsey: Because I was able to prepare the data set for the Booking Data Dashboard. It's not perfect. We will talk about it in upcoming calls we need to schedule, probably during the calls we schedule to discuss the scope of the Booking Data Dashboard development.

102
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:43.120
Franklin Dorsey: The thing is, that Quest Enterprises would want to have like a week-long initial engagement

103
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.760
Franklin Dorsey: first,

104
00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:52.760
Franklin Dorsey: where we will see what was done by Quiznos Analytics Professional Services, and then we would want to pause this engagement for an indeterminate period to allow Quest Enterprises to get acquainted with that specific work and deliverables.

105
00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:53.950
Franklin Dorsey: And after that pause, Quest Enterprises would want re-engage with Quiznos Analytics Professional Services, with some more questions, and resume the engagement for the remaining duration of forty billable hours.

106
00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:14.920
Franklin Dorsey: What we don't understand, but we will not be able to reproduce ourselves, because we don't understand some pieces of it, and then we would want to get the like. The second week of this engagement. If that makes sense for the activities and deliverables necessary to address the Training and Data Cataloging areas of interest. And all of this area encompassing the

107
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.730
Franklin Dorsey: Data Governance piece, as well as

108
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:21.610
Franklin Dorsey: more questions and so on. I'm not sure if

109
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.749
Franklin Dorsey: one week, this first week will be enough

110
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:32.559
Franklin Dorsey: to deliver the Booking Data Dashboard and resolve the issue with the Quiznos Analytics ServiceNow Data Connector, enabling access to the ServiceNow data and integration with the ServiceNow database.

111
00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:45.099
Franklin Dorsey: If that will be not enough, we can take more time. But Quest Enterprises would want to get some break in the middle, so we can get acquainted with what was done and get back to Quiznos Analytics Professional Services with questions.

112
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.660
Franklin Dorsey: Okay.

113
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:51.899
Franklin Dorsey: So that's like the overall timeline

114
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:58.230
Franklin Dorsey: that we see. There are no hard deadlines for Quest Enterprises for when this needs to be done.

115
00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.249
Franklin Dorsey: And the answer to the 'Engagement Team' question will be me

116
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.280
Franklin Dorsey: and my director, Edward Chase.

117
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:14.699
Franklin Dorsey: Edward Chase will be the decision maker, probably with any need to increase the number of Quiznos Analytics Professional Service's billable hours or any additional engagements with Quiznos Analytics Professional Services. If either of those contingencies were going to happen.

118
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:19.989
Franklin Dorsey: And the other member of the 'Engagement Team' from Quest Enterprises will be Andrew Neighbor, from the Quest Enterprises Finance Team.

119
00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:34.299
Franklin Dorsey: Andrew Neighbor is a Senior Financial Analyst with Quest Enterprises. Andrew Neighbor is the primary stakeholder of the Booking Data Dashboard. Amal will be maintaining the Booking Data Dashboard, changing it, and improving it, based on the requirements he receives from other Quest Enterprises Finance Team Stakeholders.

120
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.410
Franklin Dorsey: And another member of the 'Engagement Team' but

121
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:40.989
Franklin Dorsey: less involved, will be Shannon Stone.

122
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.859
Franklin Dorsey: Shannon Stone is Andrew Neighbor's

123
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.120
Franklin Dorsey: manager. And the final member of the 'Engagement Team' from Quest Enterprises is this engagement's

124
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:48.199
Franklin Dorsey: sponsor, Eileen Brown.

125
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.260
Franklin Dorsey: That's like the whole team from Quest Enterprises that will be working on this small project, and each of their names should be added as responses to the 'Engagement Team' question.

126
00:12:54.100 --> 00:13:08.039
Bob Jones: Okay, that's perfect, and what we can do is one thing I love about using, recording the meeting and using the transcript is, I'll come back to you just to confirm spellings and titles for the folks we just talked about.

127
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:32.629
Bob Jones: So we don't have to worry about it right now, and agreed. So from Quiznos Analytics Professional Services, the names that should be added as responses to the 'Engagement Team' question are: Bob Jones and Vincent Martin. So I'll give you just the quick version of my background. So my name is Bob Jones and I've been with Quiznos Analytics for the past six years. I've been working with the Quiznos Analytics platform for over 10 years. I've been focused on Quiznos Analytics Sense for the last

128
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.789
Bob Jones: 5 or 6 years.

129
00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.729
Bob Jones: I tend to

130
00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.730
Bob Jones: focus on the Data Modeling process all the way

131
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:45.079
Bob Jones: into Dashboard design

132
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:48.119
Bob Jones: and creation, as well as

133
00:13:48.932 --> 00:13:51.830
Bob Jones: the more recent

134
00:13:52.591 --> 00:13:56.168
Bob Jones: features in the Quiznos Analytics Cloud Platform, like

135
00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:03.329
Bob Jones: Quiznos Analytics Alerting. Or, for instance, the Quiznos Analytics Answers product launch is coming up. So I've spent the last month

136
00:14:04.045 --> 00:14:08.509
Bob Jones: getting up to speed on the pre-release version of that product.

137
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:16.299
Bob Jones: I have about 25 plus years in this Business Intelligence game.

138
00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.060
Bob Jones: And that's my background.

139
00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.910
Franklin Dorsey: We are very excited to begin this engagement.

140
00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.480
Franklin Dorsey: I see

141
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.149
Franklin Dorsey: we are in good hands.

142
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:35.450
Bob Jones: I hope so. I very much enjoy what I do. This engagement appears to present a lot of opportunity to build a great foundation. I'll also be supported by

143
00:14:35.809 --> 00:14:53.439
Bob Jones: the Quiznos Analytics Professional Services folks that you've been on the phone with during your previous calls this past April and June. So, for instance, Vincent Martin, is someone who, one of the people I would report up into and he's in management of Quiznos Analytics Professional Services, but he has many years under his belt of delivering Quiznos Analytics implementations

144
00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.899
Bob Jones: and Andrew Lancer

145
00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:10.940
Bob Jones: again, also from a platform implementation and maintenance. And obviously because I'm with Quiznos Analytics, I have access to resources. So if there are questions that come up along the way, and then also

146
00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.780
Bob Jones: I can give you, I'm happy to provide

147
00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:22.609
Bob Jones: advice about how to navigate Quiznos Analytics as an organization. So you know, in terms of support.

148
00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.769
Bob Jones: getting previews or access or things like that without

149
00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:41.489
Bob Jones: they basically skipping, skipping the line. So alright, and I think we've talked pretty well about. So I appreciate the you sharing the team from your side. Based our conversation thus far, I think we've answered the 'Overview' question.

150
00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:45.540
Bob Jones: Alright, let's discuss how to answer the 'Post Implementation' question.

151
00:15:46.340 --> 00:16:04.659
Bob Jones: I guess this would be a good time. So for key milestones and post implementation, which we can kind of consider post implementation, a milestone as well. I understand what you shared with me about. We want to see what we want to see, what we can get done in a 40 h block.

152
00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:09.909
Bob Jones: and then provide an opportunity for you all

153
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.459
Bob Jones: to digest what has been delivered.

154
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:19.840
Bob Jones: and then come back with another block. Ideally 40 h

155
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.524
Bob Jones: to address what comes up during that

156
00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.679
Bob Jones: break period.

157
00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.320
Franklin Dorsey: That's super!

158
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:36.260
Bob Jones: Okay? So I think kind of naturally, then, would be, for instance, a Milestone would be the end of this, the end of the 1st block.

159
00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.530
Bob Jones: The beginning of the

160
00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:40.600
Bob Jones: second block

161
00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.430
Bob Jones: which would largely be

162
00:16:44.417 --> 00:16:47.502
Bob Jones: you and your colleagues presenting

163
00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.640
Bob Jones: what you want to get out of the second

164
00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.379
Bob Jones: block of time,

165
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.866
Bob Jones: and then

166
00:16:55.790 --> 00:17:01.009
Bob Jones: a meeting or review at the end of that second 40 hours.

167
00:17:03.365 --> 00:17:08.139
Bob Jones: And so one thing I can think of for this week, or say over the next 24

168
00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:11.560
Bob Jones: to 48 hours would be for you and I

169
00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:13.529
Bob Jones: to create some sort

170
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.990
Bob Jones: of work plan

171
00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.640
Bob Jones: for this 1st block,

172
00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:33.259
Bob Jones: and what we anticipate currently for the second block, because we don't quite know what you're going to get, but I feel like, perhaps by the end of the day tomorrow, Tuesday, July 16, 2024 or before noon on Wednesday, July 17, 2024.

173
00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:35.900
Bob Jones: we're gonna want to

174
00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.089
Bob Jones: agree on and create a Phase One Work Plan Document that details what are we delivering

175
00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.310
Bob Jones: this week

176
00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.610
Bob Jones: in terms of whether we'll have enough time to

177
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:49.829
Bob Jones: fix the Quiznos Analytics ServiceNow Data Connector,

178
00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.749
Bob Jones: how much can we get built out of the Booking Data Dashboard,

179
00:17:55.244 --> 00:18:05.109
Bob Jones: and then for the Training Material? And I know it sounds a little silly that the Engagement's Phase One will only be 5 days long, and we wouldn't review a first draft of the Phase One Work Plan Document until the end of the Engagement's Phase One second day or the beginning of the Engagement's Phase One third day.

180
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.099
Bob Jones: Does that make sense that within the next

181
00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:18.490
Bob Jones: day and a half to 2 days we draft a Phase One Work Plan Document? I'll draft the initial Phase One Work Plan Document that we can review and agree that it contains

182
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.700
Bob Jones: an accurate depiction of our Engagement Roadmap or Engagement Work Plan for delivery of Engagement Phase One activities and deliverables. Do you agree with that approach, Filip?

183
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:29.522
Franklin Dorsey: All right. Great. That sounds good, and so I don't really know about in terms of the break how we incorporate that into the current Engagement.

184
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:38.870
Bob Jones: The beauty of being the client is you're the client, so we'll figure out how to make this work. And another reason, I think it's important that we

185
00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:52.571
Bob Jones: document these kinds of things. If whatever reason, I'm not the person who is working with you at the second piece. I anticipate I will be. But if there's a break we'll just need to make sure about that.

186
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:56.189
Bob Jones: We'll make sure there won't be any hiccups or

187
00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:57.770
Bob Jones: learning curve if a different Quiznos Analytics Professional Services Consultant is assigned to complete the Engagement's second half (i.e., Phase Two).

188
00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:02.040
Bob Jones: Alright. So that sounds good for the Engagement's

189
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.079
Franklin Dorsey: 'Results and Achievements' question. Obviously.

190
00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.519
Bob Jones: I think this would be more of.

191
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:12.019
Bob Jones: You've shared with me. What your objectives are

192
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.070
Bob Jones: in relation to providing the details to answer the 'Quantifiable

193
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:16.920
Bob Jones: Improvements' question.

194
00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:24.159
Bob Jones: I believe 'Quantifiable Improvements' would be described as improvements

195
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:31.900
Bob Jones: over Quest Enterprises's state of operations prior to implementing it's Quiznos Analytics Cloud Platform and the completion of this engagement. We don't need to be slavishly thorough here. But are there things just

196
00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.810
Bob Jones: off the top of your head that

197
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:40.040
Bob Jones: you're associating with Quest Enterprises achieving the three things we talked about earlier.

198
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:44.179
Franklin Dorsey: Yes, that's exactly how we can put it.

199
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:53.389
Franklin Dorsey: If we accomplish the three things we talked about earlier, Quest Enterprises will get a Booking Data Dashboard with reports and associated functionality at the end of the Engagement's entire eighty-hour block of billable hours.

200
00:19:53.520 --> 00:20:00.059
Franklin Dorsey: And Quest Enterprises will have no further questions, and will understand how to start maintaining and improving the Booking Data Dashboard.

201
00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.649
Franklin Dorsey: That's a 'Quantifiable Improvement' associated with achieving the first of the three things we discussed earlier during this conversation.

202
00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.190
Franklin Dorsey: That will be a measurable result for Quest Enterprises.

203
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:13.089
Franklin Dorsey: The second measurable result will be resolving the current issue preventing Quest Enterprises's use of the Quiznos Analytics ServiceNow Data Connector: If the Quiznos Analytics ServiceNow Data Connector will be working for the ServiceNow data

204
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:20.259
Franklin Dorsey: that we want to begin importing into Quiznos Analytics Sense, and we are able to understand

205
00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.660
Franklin Dorsey: how to write the connection

206
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:23.120
Franklin Dorsey: for the next

207
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:31.700
Franklin Dorsey: data sets that we will want to put in. That's another measurable achievement for Quest Enterprises.

208
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:40.699
Franklin Dorsey: The third 'Quantifiable Improvement' will be the creation of a Data Catalogue or Data Catalogue for the Quest Enterprises Teams using the Quiznos Analytics Cloud Platform. And Quest Enterprises knowing how to improve the Data Catalogue and

209
00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:44.080
Franklin Dorsey: and use it productively. That achievement would be the 3rd thing.

210
00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:55.619
Bob Jones: Okay, and when you say Data Catalog, are you referring specifically to the Quiznos Analytics Data Catalog component? Or are you using the term 'Data Catalogue' in the generic sense?

211
00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:21.490
Franklin Dorsey: I am using the term 'Data Catalog' more generically. I'm using it more generically. We would want to introduce, like kind of a Data Catalog as a concept in Quest Enterprises. In general, we do not have. I think we do not have the Quiznos Analytics Data Catalog product if that's an actual Quiznos Analytics product. So when I refer to a Data Catalog, I'm thinking about a place where people would be able to just go in, see what's available and

212
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:27.730
Franklin Dorsey: read about this a bit to understand the data points that are there, and just make sure that

213
00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.570
Franklin Dorsey: they know what

214
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.170
Franklin Dorsey: they can do with it.

215
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:41.219
Bob Jones: Okay, I understand what you are saying,

216
00:21:42.096 --> 00:21:42.803
Bob Jones: and

217
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:52.700
Bob Jones:  we can come up with an initial scalable Data Catalog solution that you could implement just within Quest Enterprises's existing Quiznos Analytics Cloud Platform, using Quiznos Analytics Sense. So, for instance,

218
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:58.270
Bob Jones: whether it's within individual dashboards having one sheet

219
00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.360
Bob Jones: that provides a catalog

220
00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.649
Bob Jones: of the dimensions and measures.

221
00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.920
Bob Jones: with more with metadata associated

222
00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.119
Bob Jones: with those elements,

223
00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.659
Bob Jones: even rolling up the details for easy investigation.

224
00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.950
Bob Jones: So one, I think one step would be, you know.

225
00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:29.040
Bob Jones: at the individual application or dashboard level within boiling it up so that that information would be centralized so that the maintenance of it.

226
00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:35.609
Bob Jones: So, for instance, the Quest Enterprises Finance Team Members using Quiznos Analytics Sense could have, or will have ownership of that, so it won't be

227
00:22:36.882 --> 00:22:39.080
Bob Jones: it is struggling

228
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:44.679
Bob Jones: to try and read minds or chase people to see if things have been updated. So

229
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:48.109
Bob Jones: okay, yeah, and understood

230
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.600
Bob Jones: alright. And so I think that covers that beautifully.

231
00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:58.080
Bob Jones: Okay, now let's discuss the question 'Adoption Usage'. I think the answer to this question will be pretty straightforward. As you said, Quiznos Analytics Cloud is a new

232
00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:05.250
Bob Jones: platform for Quest Enterprises. So we should just be able to use

233
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:08.800
Bob Jones: the existing Quiznos Analytics Sense Administration Monitoring

234
00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:14.279
Bob Jones: dashboard to measure New User rates

235
00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.000
Bob Jones: as well as System Usage Rates by multiple dimensions.

236
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.960
Bob Jones: Additionally,

237
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:27.579
Bob Jones: I can show you how to easily access the data populating that dashboard if for whatever reason you want to build a separate dashboard

238
00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:30.620
Bob Jones: or extend that dashboard group.

239
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:32.469
Franklin Dorsey: Excellent. Yes.

240
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.669
Bob Jones: Okay, great alright. And

241
00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:42.979
Bob Jones: let's see. So we've attempted to answer the 'Results and Achievements' question, and we've also attempted to answer the 'Adoption and Usage' question. That brings us to the 'Financial Impact' question.

242
00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:50.120
Bob Jones: To answer the 'Financial Impact' question we need to calculate Quest Enterprises's anticipated Return on Investment (ROI).

243
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:54.249
Bob Jones: Do you have thoughts about whether Quest Enterprises is anticipating a positive Return on Investment from this engagement, and if there are specific use cases we can identify and use

244
00:23:54.630 --> 00:24:00.350
Bob Jones: to measure and report the Return on Investment

245
00:24:01.417 --> 00:24:06.919
Bob Jones: anticipated from successfully completing this engagement?

246
00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:13.390
Franklin Dorsey: It will be time saving definitely because we are trying to move

247
00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:18.020
Franklin Dorsey: this this small project. Let's call it a Proof of Concept (POC) of Quiznos Analytics

248
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:23.389
Franklin Dorsey: should be like a guidance for bigger teams

249
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:28.380
Franklin Dorsey: to start adopting Quiznos Analytics. And with this engagement

250
00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:31.320
Franklin Dorsey: we will not see a lot of improvement.

251
00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:43.350
Franklin Dorsey: it will be because Amal will be offloaded from the manual things that he would have to do on the spreadsheet and importing data and changing in data manually.

252
00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:51.730
Franklin Dorsey: but and of course, the way that the visualizations will be prepared would be much easier to understand and

253
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:55.250
Franklin Dorsey: beautiful, not like we have now.

254
00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.730
Franklin Dorsey: So that's

255
00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:01.870
Franklin Dorsey: like minimal level that we will go with. But the next step will be

256
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:10.579
Franklin Dorsey: to decrease the number of time that people are spend spending on preparation of any kind of reports that

257
00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:15.200
Franklin Dorsey: we have in the Revenue Operations Team, for example, or in

258
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:26.390
Franklin Dorsey: and in the wider Financial Team or in Marketing. Maybe this. They are all connected with spreadsheets,

259
00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:33.770
Franklin Dorsey: and with exporting and importing data. Everything is in different places. So it's hard to find. It's not

260
00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:36.770
Franklin Dorsey: unified between the teams. So

261
00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:44.389
Franklin Dorsey: if we will be able to adopt Quiznos Analytics in all of those teams, it's going to be a time saver, and so resulting in cost savings.

262
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:57.116
Bob Jones: That's perfect. I appreciate it. I do want to apologize. I'm about to get up and take a toy away from my dog, Sadie, which I'm not sure if you can hear the squeaking she's making from playing with the toy.

263
00:25:58.321 --> 00:26:05.700
Franklin Dorsey: I also have one, my son, just my son just woke him up. So

264
00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:07.240
Franklin Dorsey: it's the same thing, I guess.

265
00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:19.410
Bob Jones: So. Yeah, that sounds like we're in the same boat here. Thank you for that. That is very helpful. It raises one question for me, which is in terms of dashboard development.

266
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.870
Bob Jones: Upfront initially or moving forward.

267
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:31.369
Bob Jones: How will the Quiznos Analytics Sense dashboards be built? Will Quest Enterprises have a team of Quiznos Analytics Sense Application Developers who'll be building those dashboards based on requirements

268
00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:35.509
Bob Jones: from end users? Or is the Quiznos Analytics Sense dashboard development going to be blended where you're going to be

269
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:40.890
Bob Jones: empowering end users to create their own dashboards.

270
00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:51.769
Franklin Dorsey: More of the second approach. I will be like a Data Engineer Architect that will be bringing the data in, together with the Data Stewards.

271
00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:56.650
Franklin Dorsey: I'll be preparing the data sets, and then the Data Stewards,

272
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.280
Franklin Dorsey: or particular

273
00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:04.919
Franklin Dorsey: Quest Enterprises Department Teams will be responsible for preparation of the

274
00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:09.089
Franklin Dorsey: of the Quiznos Analytics Sense dashboard visualizations. That's why we would want to develop

275
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:14.079
Franklin Dorsey: this kind of Training Material we've been discussing, that will simplify the learning curve for them.

276
00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:24.220
Franklin Dorsey: We will also, me and Amal will be like the guidance for the newcomers, and we will help them adopt and understand how to use Quiznos Analytics Sense.

277
00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:31.539
Bob Jones: So that's very helpful. What I would foresee is that

278
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:33.350
Bob Jones: we will have

279
00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:40.630
Bob Jones: two different segments of Quiznos Analytics Users across Quest Enterprises.

280
00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:54.959
Bob Jones: I would see the priority being, and forgive me because I don't know enough about your background. But we would want to make sure that there's a structure around how Quiznos Analytics Data Models are created. So

281
00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:01.340
Bob Jones: I would see if you're gonna have end users creating the front end, which is

282
00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:06.929
Bob Jones: which is great. I mean, that product is, you know, kind of architected for that.

283
00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.564
Bob Jones: You'd wanna have

284
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:13.720
Bob Jones: a library of data models.

285
00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:19.270
Bob Jones: That would be plug and play if you will, or

286
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:22.620
Bob Jones: for instance, beginning with QVDs.

287
00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:27.149
Bob Jones: then Quiznos Analytics Sense applications that contain Quiznos Analytics Data Models

288
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.604
Bob Jones: that could then just be

289
00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:34.080
Bob Jones: attached, if you will, to a new Quiznos Analytics Sense

290
00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:42.769
Bob Jones: application. And so the end user would never have to think about what Data Model they're using. All they're doing is just focusing on

291
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.110
Bob Jones: creating visualizations based on known dimensions and measures.

292
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:54.980
Bob Jones: So, yeah, that's that sounds exactly how you would want to approach this.

293
00:28:55.586 --> 00:29:12.230
Franklin Dorsey: If there will be some missing pieces in the data sets. I would expect the Data Stewards to come to me, and we will work out the changes that should have been done on the data sets that are connected to the, to the Data Models, to the Quiznos Analytics Sense applications.

294
00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:27.880
Franklin Dorsey: Okay, I understand what it is. But I'm trying to learn it. And I would appreciate your help with it. If we will be using any of these during this engagement, I would be happy to see it.

295
00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:37.039
Bob Jones: Yeah, absolutely. So I think what we could do is we can use the Booking Data Dashboard as a Use Case, if you will.

296
00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:41.620
Franklin Dorsey: Excellent for best practice for that so, for instance.

297
00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:54.069
Franklin Dorsey: the best practice would be something approximating a 3 tiered architecture, which is a very fancy way of saying a base layer of

298
00:29:55.292 --> 00:30:06.867
Franklin Dorsey: where you would say import tables as a select star, and you would import those, let's say, on a daily basis. Each table would be

299
00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:11.480
Franklin Dorsey: converted each night into a Qvd. Document.

300
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:28.400
Franklin Dorsey: And then that way. There's a single instance of that database table as a Qvd. That can be reused many times, and then the second layer of the 3 pieces would be a data model where you are. You create a Quiznos Analytics Sense application

301
00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:31.769
Franklin Dorsey: and using Qvd documents.

302
00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:32.870
Franklin Dorsey: and

303
00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:39.769
Franklin Dorsey: you would then design a data model to support a particular domain. So, for instance, finance

304
00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:40.920
Franklin Dorsey: on.

305
00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:48.230
Franklin Dorsey: and then that sorry and that data model, it would then be reusable. The objective would be

306
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:49.989
Franklin Dorsey: a data model that

307
00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:56.349
Franklin Dorsey: could be reused by anyone who's interested in finance for whatever specific

308
00:30:56.710 --> 00:31:00.470
Franklin Dorsey: objectives they have. But everyone would be using

309
00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.739
Franklin Dorsey: the same, the same data.

310
00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:08.319
Franklin Dorsey: and then the final tier of it would just be in the Ui.

311
00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:14.659
Franklin Dorsey: We'd make sure that there was a consistent. We'd want to create master dimensions and master measures.

312
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:27.239
Franklin Dorsey: So, for instance, if finance, if Perkona, for instance, had operating units in different geographies or different market segments that perhaps have a different

313
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:29.859
Franklin Dorsey: formula for revenue.

314
00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:34.960
Franklin Dorsey: We would want to create standard master measures for those.

315
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:37.020
Franklin Dorsey: Exactly. Yes. Yeah.

316
00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:48.989
Franklin Dorsey: Okay, so. And the good. What I heard you say at the beginning of this call was something akin to beginning modestly and then iterating and scaling. And so

317
00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:55.690
Franklin Dorsey: what we can do over the we can just use that booking data. Dashboard is an opportunity

318
00:31:56.252 --> 00:32:01.460
Franklin Dorsey: to to do that. So it sounds like we wanna make things that

319
00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:06.375
Franklin Dorsey: we'll use this 1st phase I use the phrase,

320
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:25.669
Franklin Dorsey: I think it's called a self evidencing or self. Basically what it is is the the thing we build will be an example of how to do what you want to do. So the objective is, it won't just be. We need to create booking dashboards. But we need to create booking dashboards

321
00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:28.620
Franklin Dorsey: in a method in which

322
00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:32.089
Franklin Dorsey: that deliverable is instructive of how to

323
00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:36.659
Franklin Dorsey: begin creating other dashboards in other areas of the business.

324
00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:39.890
Franklin Dorsey: Sounds excellent.

325
00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:44.310
Franklin Dorsey: Okay, yeah, I don't want to over promise. But I think that's that will be a good approach.

326
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.080
Franklin Dorsey: That sounds good approach for us.

327
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:56.210
Franklin Dorsey: right? And that's exactly what I was thinking about this kind of structure, where we will deliver self service for the users that will be educated enough to use it.

328
00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:03.126
Franklin Dorsey: That's great phrase. So it sounds like, that's really the end game for you.

329
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:11.330
Franklin Dorsey: okay, yeah. I think that really does kind of it imposes a structure on how

330
00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:13.020
Franklin Dorsey: you know what.

331
00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:15.699
Franklin Dorsey: what we're gonna want to get done

332
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:20.150
Franklin Dorsey: so that you have a chance to work with it. I think it means more of a focus.

333
00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:27.760
Franklin Dorsey: I think it means more of a focus on the the development process, whether that's in the back end or the front end

334
00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.329
Franklin Dorsey: and then with the service. Now, Connector.

335
00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.660
Franklin Dorsey: I think what I'd like to do is

336
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:37.250
Franklin Dorsey: if we can take a look at that.

337
00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:43.820
Franklin Dorsey: and then I could just quickly identify. If it's something that's either going to take me too long.

338
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:49.989
Franklin Dorsey: or isn't something that I'm capable of getting done. I can just quickly hand off

339
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:55.430
Franklin Dorsey: that task and the associated hours to someone who does it all day long.

340
00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.540
Franklin Dorsey: Okay?

341
00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:58.929
Franklin Dorsey: So I think that way.

342
00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:05.210
Franklin Dorsey: I'm using my hours effectively. So either I can get it done, or I'm going to get somebody

343
00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.480
Franklin Dorsey: who can get it done for us.

344
00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:16.229
Franklin Dorsey: and I won't. I won't distract myself with with the connector. Is it that you want to use the connector strictly within

345
00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:24.019
Franklin Dorsey: Quiznos Analytics Sense applications? Or is it that you're using the connector in external applications or pipelines that you're building?

346
00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:31.640
Franklin Dorsey: I was trying to use it in Quiznos Analytics Sense. I was trying to connect to ServiceNow, and I was trying to pull in some data

347
00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:33.770
Franklin Dorsey: directly from ServiceNow.

348
00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:46.619
Franklin Dorsey: and it didn't work with the normal approach, and then I was by support I was told that I should be using. I should try at least to use the Api calls.

349
00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:58.929
Franklin Dorsey: and I tried and seemed like some of the tables were were being uploaded, but some of them were problematic, and I'm not sure why it's happening. Maybe it's

350
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.910
Franklin Dorsey: it might be our data.

351
00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:06.070
Franklin Dorsey: But if it is, I also would want to understand how we can handle things like that.

352
00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.709
Franklin Dorsey: Yeah, absolutely. I I doubt it's and well, who knows we.

353
00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:20.000
Franklin Dorsey: So I feel like we've done a with your help. I think we've done a nice job with covering off on everything the visuals.

354
00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:24.439
Franklin Dorsey: Those are really just a function of. If we have everything else defined.

355
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:29.258
Franklin Dorsey: we can just decide. So I think we've covered all of that

356
00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:35.110
Franklin Dorsey: and I I feel like you've over the course of this conversation. You've covered

357
00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:38.529
Franklin Dorsey: the project, timeline. Would would that

358
00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:50.769
Franklin Dorsey: would that be correct? If you like, handle on what you want. One thing I'm going to disadvantage of is my colleagues. Quiznos Analytics, colleagues have sent me some screenshots of some really excellently

359
00:35:50.910 --> 00:36:06.840
Franklin Dorsey: documented measure. Definitions and things are those part of something that you put together for this particular effort. It is. Yes, that's probably from the documents that I'm going to send to you. Okay.

360
00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:12.439
Franklin Dorsey: alright. And those would be associated with the booking booking data.

361
00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:14.640
Franklin Dorsey: Okay.

362
00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.120
Franklin Dorsey: that's great. So

363
00:36:17.678 --> 00:36:21.349
Franklin Dorsey: what I'll do is when we've completed this call

364
00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:25.670
Franklin Dorsey: I'll receive those and and go through those.

365
00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:33.359
Franklin Dorsey: And again, it's like a 99% of the instances. I never get that level of documentation. So it's

366
00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:34.750
Franklin Dorsey: it's great.

367
00:36:35.465 --> 00:36:40.090
Franklin Dorsey: Is there? Are there any other materials or things like that that

368
00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:44.510
Franklin Dorsey: I'm going to be able to review, or that you want me

369
00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:46.289
Franklin Dorsey: to have access to.

370
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:54.039
Franklin Dorsey: for now we only have this document. That's is is prepared by Amal. So he prepared this, based on

371
00:36:54.340 --> 00:37:09.379
Franklin Dorsey: his knowledge how it could be prepared. I reviewed it with him, and the level of details that is included here. We we suppose that it is enough, but if it wouldn't, we would want to also understand

372
00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:25.019
Franklin Dorsey: what kind of level of details would you need to to move on and to understand that the end goal, because it might not be everything. But this is the only document that we have, because the used cases is not that big. So we didn't prepare anything else.

373
00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:27.920
Franklin Dorsey: Okay, no, I'll I'll

374
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:31.610
Franklin Dorsey: review it. And again, I rarely.

375
00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:36.749
Franklin Dorsey: I rarely have anything written. I rarely receive anything that has been written down.

376
00:37:37.177 --> 00:37:47.980
Franklin Dorsey: Or at least, you know it's handwritten. I'm glad that I'm doing great job. Yes, I mean it does. It sounds like I'm just sucking up to you. But no, this is.

377
00:37:48.190 --> 00:38:00.219
Franklin Dorsey: you guys seem to really have your ducks in a row, so I'm glad. All right. So, knowing that then I have access to the in in terms of the tenant that I have access to.

378
00:38:01.078 --> 00:38:06.120
Franklin Dorsey: I'll share my screen here. And let's just make sure.

379
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:07.860
Franklin Dorsey: See if I have anything

380
00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:09.980
Franklin Dorsey: that I can drive around to?

381
00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:20.271
Franklin Dorsey: so just please let me know if you're able to see my screen. See it. Okay.

382
00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.470
Franklin Dorsey: so

383
00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:24.390
Franklin Dorsey: is there anything

384
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:28.470
Franklin Dorsey: you don't see anything? Okay.

385
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:30.869
Franklin Dorsey: let me go to catalog and see.

386
00:38:33.916 --> 00:38:42.660
Franklin Dorsey: So I would have to add you to the groups that okay, I know what I have to do. I'll add you to the groups. And

387
00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:48.490
Franklin Dorsey: do you have 5 min, or just like, Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. I'm your. I'm all yours

388
00:38:48.975 --> 00:38:51.639
Franklin Dorsey: for for better or for worse, I'm all yours.

389
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:56.709
Franklin Dorsey: So spaces, I think that's spaces.

390
00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:00.739
Franklin Dorsey: I was logged out one sec.

391
00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:21.559
Franklin Dorsey: Yeah, if if possible. And pardon me for talking while you're trying to get stuff done there, but the best for me is to either have root, admin access, or

392
00:39:21.964 --> 00:39:25.090
Franklin Dorsey: it can walk you through the others so that I can

393
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:30.409
Franklin Dorsey: be it the admin admin, console, and things like that.

394
00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.780
Franklin Dorsey: Add member

395
00:39:37.903 --> 00:39:41.676
Franklin Dorsey: and since I'm a like, I'm an insufferable talker while you're

396
00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:48.290
Franklin Dorsey: While you're doing that, D, does Perkona have access to Quiznos Analytics training? Is that something?

397
00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:51.889
Franklin Dorsey: Because that's helpful for me to know?

398
00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:57.479
Franklin Dorsey: I think we do, and we, me and Amal, we will attend

399
00:39:58.090 --> 00:39:59.469
Franklin Dorsey: a training

400
00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:02.360
Franklin Dorsey: additional training for the visualizations

401
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.200
Franklin Dorsey: like the like. The

402
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:10.939
Franklin Dorsey: someone will lead it. I think that's

403
00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:16.919
Franklin Dorsey: it's like a virtual session for our for 2 days that we will have with Amal.

404
00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:23.489
Franklin Dorsey: Okay, so that's it you have in person, whether it's virtual or not, it's in person training.

405
00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:25.200
Franklin Dorsey: Yes, yes.

406
00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:28.582
Franklin Dorsey: okay. So I'll find out if you have.

407
00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:32.139
Franklin Dorsey: I don't know if you're able to see my screen. This is

408
00:40:33.134 --> 00:40:34.679
Franklin Dorsey: it's called Quiznos Analytics

409
00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:40.819
Franklin Dorsey: continuous classroom. Exactly. Yeah. I saw this. Do you have access to this?

410
00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:46.650
Franklin Dorsey: Yes. Oh, great. Okay. So among the things we can do. It'll be.

411
00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:50.429
Franklin Dorsey: you know, very easy is, we can also

412
00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:58.860
Franklin Dorsey: put together a curriculum for your new users to take advantage of this, because this training really is excellent. It has.

413
00:40:59.575 --> 00:41:05.099
Franklin Dorsey: Not only is it very bite size in terms of video instruction, but it comes with

414
00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:08.791
Franklin Dorsey: quite a bit of sample data,

415
00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:14.959
Franklin Dorsey: applications that mirror the content that's been reviewed during the

416
00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.219
Franklin Dorsey: the lessons and things like that.

417
00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:30.619
Franklin Dorsey: That's exactly what I would want to do with you at the end, when we will be done with 2 main goals. I would want to go through this and just collect like the like. You said the curriculum for the new users that will come in and

418
00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:34.209
Franklin Dorsey: we'll we will just address the learning curve here.

419
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:39.519
Franklin Dorsey: Okay, great. So no matter what we get done in the 1st week.

420
00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:43.390
Franklin Dorsey: As long as we carve out 2 or 3 h

421
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:47.250
Franklin Dorsey: we'll be able to at a minimum put together

422
00:41:47.834 --> 00:41:56.060
Franklin Dorsey: roadmaps if you will, for the different user. User segments for for your tenant.

423
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:57.719
Franklin Dorsey: Great. Okay. Users.

424
00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:06.710
Franklin Dorsey: Alright to the instance. You should see something more now, maybe. Okay.

425
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:10.660
Franklin Dorsey: Great. Okay, thanks.

426
00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:12.480
Franklin Dorsey: The bookings is

427
00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:13.760
Franklin Dorsey: the one.

428
00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:16.810
Franklin Dorsey: Probably this one is

429
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:26.300
Franklin Dorsey: right.

430
00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:29.800
Franklin Dorsey: And alright. So what a

431
00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:38.265
Franklin Dorsey: what? I'm gonna be able if you don't mind, I'm gonna go back. What I want to be able to do is look at the data model. So I can see what I have.

432
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:40.230
Franklin Dorsey: so you're probably missing some

433
00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:41.910
Franklin Dorsey: privileges right?

434
00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:46.470
Franklin Dorsey: What I what should I do to give you like

435
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:52.430
Franklin Dorsey: higher level access, which which privileges should I set?

436
00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:59.790
Franklin Dorsey: I will take a look for you in just a second. Let me just do so. I want to go to the data load, editor.

437
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:05.400
Franklin Dorsey: and this is the main things I want to make sure I have access to whatever data connections you want me to have

438
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:07.130
Franklin Dorsey: access to.

439
00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:11.749
Franklin Dorsey: So I have Salesforce. But I don't have service. Now.

440
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:16.930
Franklin Dorsey: let's see, yeah, ServiceNow does exist, because it's it's not here.

441
00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:20.478
Franklin Dorsey: I'll add you to the second group. Yeah, that's right.

442
00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:28.220
Franklin Dorsey: And then, if you don't mind, we can. Also, we can walk through. And so now we'll have a video of it.

443
00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:32.749
Franklin Dorsey: just just specifically what the issue is. And that way.

444
00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:37.250
Franklin Dorsey: if if I don't think I can solve it for you in a timely manner.

445
00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:44.580
Franklin Dorsey: I'll pull in someone who can, and I can have them watch that section of the video. So you don't have to go over it again.

446
00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:47.210
Franklin Dorsey: Okay, I think we should see it.

447
00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:49.310
Franklin Dorsey: ken.

448
00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:57.269
Franklin Dorsey: Well, it's it's not in this

449
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:59.740
Franklin Dorsey: application. It's okay.

450
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:06.200
Franklin Dorsey: right business services. That should be it.

451
00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:15.860
Franklin Dorsey: It doesn't show up. Oh, yeah. So I understand. I get it. So it's not in there. Let's see if I'm

452
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:30.330
Franklin Dorsey: I see. And this is how you where you were encountering an issue. Right? It's just at this, the create connection.

453
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:35.030
Franklin Dorsey: Yes, this didn't work. And then.

454
00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:40.930
Franklin Dorsey: within the one of the applications. I have a data load script where I,

455
00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:51.120
Franklin Dorsey: where I started manipulating the data script, the the load script. And there I was able to identify what was the problem with which table?

456
00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:54.900
Franklin Dorsey: And but I I not sure. Why?

457
00:44:55.090 --> 00:45:02.600
Franklin Dorsey: Okay, well, would you? How about we? I turn the you can share your screen. We'll go into that application and take a look.

458
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.980
Franklin Dorsey: Eric.

459
00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:06.210
Franklin Dorsey: okay, great

460
00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:09.569
Franklin Dorsey: right? And is that in terms of

461
00:45:10.611 --> 00:45:13.618
Franklin Dorsey: data connection? So I have

462
00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:16.600
Franklin Dorsey: business services

463
00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:22.540
Franklin Dorsey: and finance, and so do I have what I need. So we have Salesforce bulk.

464
00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.590
Franklin Dorsey: Are there? Are there any other

465
00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:31.319
Franklin Dorsey: sources of data like, for instance, for booking data or Salesforce, where the booking data is.

466
00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:34.030
Franklin Dorsey: Salesforce is where the booking data is.

467
00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:48.619
Franklin Dorsey: and ServiceNow is going to be used for a different purpose. There will be another application that we will probably join with the Salesforce data. But for now we are just trying to make the connection for ServiceNow.

468
00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:52.870
Bob Jones: Okay, just for my own reference. And

469
00:45:53.090 --> 00:46:08.670
Bob Jones: to ensure I'm using the same business language and business terms that you are, what is Quest Enterprises's specific use of the ServiceNow platform that generates the data being used by this Quiznos Analytics Sense dashboard application? Is the data associated with Customer Service by Quest Enterprises for its customers?

470
00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:11.969
Franklin Dorsey: I can share my screen. Okay?

471
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:15.450
Bob Jones: Oh, that'd be great. Yeah. Let me stop sharing my screen here.

472
00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:21.019
Bob Jones: I'm not sure how to end my screen sharing. Oh, there you go, you're now sharing your screen. Thank you.

473
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:33.740
Franklin Dorsey: Right? So my screen is showing the Quest Enterprises Quiznos Analytics Cloud Analytics Home page. The applications visible on the page I'm currently sharing will be connecting to Quest Enterprises's Jira system. I didn't have a lot of problems with the Quiznos Analytics Jira Data Connector, so for now there will be some things that I might ask you for assistance later on.

474
00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:41.559
Franklin Dorsey: On my screen now is the Booking Data Dashboard, the application that is using the Quiznos Analytics Salesforce Data Connector.

475
00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:54.279
Franklin Dorsey: And on my screen now we have the 'ETR (Entitlement, Time, Review) Synchronization Quality Assurance Dashboard'. The 'ETR' Dashboard uses two Quiznos Analytics Data Connectors: the Quiznos Analytics Salesforce Data Connector and the Quiznos Analytics ServiceNow Data Connector.

476
00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:58.150
Bob Jones: Okay, thank you for showing me these dashboards.

477
00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.150
Franklin Dorsey: And here on my screen

478
00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:04.260
Franklin Dorsey: is the Data Load Script Editor from the 'ETR' Dashboard in which I'm

479
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:09.550
Franklin Dorsey: attempting to load data from Quest Enterprises's ServiceNow application.

480
00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.270
Franklin Dorsey: Right, and this is the Data Load Editor Sheet in which I'm using the Quiznos Analytics ServiceNow Data Connector.

481
00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:16.420
Franklin Dorsey: And when I attempt to run a reload of this application

482
00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.159
Franklin Dorsey: an error related to the Quiznos Analytics ServiceNow Data Connector is thrown and the reload fails.

483
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:40.509
Bob Jones: Thank you for the explanation. I'll get a screenshot just as soon as the Error Message

484
00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:41.860
Bob Jones: pops up on your screen.

485
00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:58.560
Bob Jones: And I'm sorry for having to ask, but what does the 'ETR' stand for in the name of Quest Enterprises's ETR Dashboard?

486
00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:01.249
Franklin Dorsey: 'ETR' stands for Entitlement Time Review

487
00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:02.310
Bob Jones: Thank you.

488
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:05.279
Bob Jones: Can you please explain the meaning of 'Entitlement Time Review'?

489
00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:14.550
Franklin Dorsey: So that is something that we are using as a concept that our Services Department, like Managed Services, are selling block of hours

490
00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:24.029
Franklin Dorsey: to our customers and the Service Entitlement for the hours that each customer can use

491
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:27.720
Franklin Dorsey: is what we are calling an Entitlement.

492
00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:39.299
Franklin Dorsey: Now, this is something that is generated, based on the contract in Salesforce, and we are moving this information to Quest Enterprises's ServiceNow system, and ServiceNow controls

493
00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:44.439
Franklin Dorsey: the amount of hours that is being utilized by specific customers.

494
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:50.470
Franklin Dorsey: And then the 'Entitlement Time Review' refers to a report that is telling us

495
00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:54.130
Franklin Dorsey: how many hours each customer used

496
00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:56.340
Franklin Dorsey: for a particular month.

497
00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:01.859
Bob Jones: Alright understood. Thank you. That's really super helpful.

498
00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:16.506
Bob Jones: May I please step away for 15 seconds? I'm gonna leave my microphone on. I'm just going to give my dog, Sadie, a treat so that she

499
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:19.659
Bob Jones: leaves me in peace here.

500
00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:23.230
Bob Jones: Alright, Sadie? Good job! Here you go, here's a treat for you!

501
00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:25.719
Bob Jones: That's right, Sadie! Good show.

502
00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:41.839
Bob Jones: Alright, Sadie. Let's go!

503
00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:50.340
Bob Jones: Okay, alright, thank you. I appreciate your patience, Filip. We can get back to reviewing your attempt to reload your Quiznos Analytics Sense application's Data Load Editor script.

504
00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:59.099
Bob Jones: Alright. I'm not going to get excited that your application's reload process hasn't failed yet. I'm assuming the failure doesn't come until later in the reload process?

505
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:01.265
Franklin Dorsey: Exactly.

506
00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:07.450
Franklin Dorsey: I'm not sure where which table it was, I think. Oh, that's seems like

507
00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.490
Franklin Dorsey: Salesforce already.

508
00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:18.350
Bob Jones: Well, it's helpful to know what is working as well. So, has it hit the Error?

509
00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:20.600
Franklin Dorsey: No.

510
00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.360
Bob Jones: Is this the same Error Message that you received before?

511
00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:26.735
Franklin Dorsey: No, no, I it's a different thing.

512
00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:36.289
Franklin Dorsey: I think. I removed the problematic line, the problematic table from the service. Now, Connector, just to see if the rest will be loading fine.

513
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:43.409
Franklin Dorsey: I'll have to add this back. I think this was problem with task table. And even though we didn't

514
00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:46.110
Franklin Dorsey: specify particular

515
00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:55.149
Franklin Dorsey: fields that we would want to ingest like we wanted to, ingest only the 'Id' field

516
00:50:55.250 --> 00:51:03.120
Franklin Dorsey: and some other specific fields. And the problem with the ingestion was in fields that were not selected by us.

517
00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.640
Franklin Dorsey: And that's something that I don't understand.

518
00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:10.565
Bob Jones: Okay, yeah, that sounds like something we may want to address somewhere within the scope of this Engagement.

519
00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:14.290
Franklin Dorsey: Great, that sounds like it should be.

520
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.133
Bob Jones: It sounds

521
00:51:18.295 --> 00:51:29.360
Bob Jones: complex enough that I wanna yeah dive into that a bit more. I I would want to say quickly, though with that circular reference. I think it

522
00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:32.269
Bob Jones: perhaps one of the

523
00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:38.850
Bob Jones: one of the elements we'll include in terms of for the back end and best practices will be

524
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:40.860
Bob Jones: optimizing

525
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:44.680
Bob Jones: the Data Models that are built

526
00:51:44.770 --> 00:51:47.779
Bob Jones: to support the front end Quiznos Analytics Sense application development (i.e. User Interface Design).

527
00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:50.759
Bob Jones: So, for instance, if we

528
00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:52.590
Bob Jones: if you're able to.

529
00:51:53.285 --> 00:52:01.270
Bob Jones: Instead of the Data Load Editor selection, in the upper left, if we just click the dropdown near there and let's just go to the Data Model Viewer, please.

530
00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:06.810
Bob Jones: And this is also part of I'm ignorant of your background. Do you have a background in

531
00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:16.579
Franklin Dorsey: like relational database design or anything like that. Oh, yes, in in a lot of things I have background in programming

532
00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:18.970
Franklin Dorsey: are in zoom.

533
00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:24.770
Bob Jones: So it sounds like, yeah, here this is, you're early in the process of all of your

534
00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:30.289
Bob Jones: testing and development and things. So this this kind of

535
00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:35.519
Bob Jones: so we'll work to make sure, because the same rules would apply

536
00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:38.859
Bob Jones: in building a Quiznos Analytics Data Model as it would with.

537
00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:43.850
Bob Jones: you know, any type of relational model where you want it to be a dimensional model,

538
00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:50.310
Bob Jones: a Star Schema, or a Snowflake Schema will generally be the most performant for modeling data in Quiznos Analytics.

539
00:52:50.956 --> 00:52:54.090
Bob Jones: And there are other data modeling techniques, depending on the data volumes and other factors.

540
00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:57.800
Bob Jones: And there are other, you know, techniques or practices.

541
00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:03.409
Bob Jones: Yeah, I'm assuming here, we're you're just.

542
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:08.910
Bob Jones: You're just trying to validate that the connections are working correctly. Is that accurate?

543
00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:12.310
Franklin Dorsey: Exactly. I was trying to

544
00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:14.250
Franklin Dorsey: reflect the

545
00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:15.990
Franklin Dorsey: the query

546
00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:25.139
Franklin Dorsey: that's I'm using in a different system, currently, because we also have a Metabase. We have this kind of dashboard

547
00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:31.059
Franklin Dorsey: and I was trying to move it to Quiznos Analytics. But I that's the problem that I faced.

548
00:53:31.810 --> 00:53:33.859
Franklin Dorsey: I'm not this. This

549
00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:36.999
Franklin Dorsey: is probably not something that should exist.

550
00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:43.659
Franklin Dorsey: but it is something that is necessary for us to understand this, because

551
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:45.050
Franklin Dorsey: there are

552
00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:50.209
Franklin Dorsey: in. I would have to show you the relevant query

553
00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:56.250
Franklin Dorsey: in the Metabase. So you can understand, what are we trying to achieve?

554
00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:59.190
Franklin Dorsey: It would be easier

555
00:53:59.210 --> 00:54:00.750
Franklin Dorsey: to do it this way.

556
00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:04.339
Franklin Dorsey: Let's maybe we do that in

557
00:54:04.850 --> 00:54:13.450
Franklin Dorsey: in on, you know. Say, tomorrow or Wednesday I will prepare myself for it. I'll I can prepare a document like this

558
00:54:14.238 --> 00:54:18.700
Franklin Dorsey: where you will have all details what we would want to do with the ETR Dashboard.

559
00:54:18.810 --> 00:54:20.176
Franklin Dorsey: And then

560
00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:26.160
Franklin Dorsey: we could go through this when I'm going to be ready for now, I don't think it would be waste of your time.

561
00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:38.479
Bob Jones: Yeah, agreed. I think it's we can be more productive. I can also just show you some techniques that are specific to Quiznos Analytics in terms of how to overcome Circular Reference issues, like that one.

562
00:54:39.074 --> 00:54:46.980
Franklin Dorsey: Understood that the data requires. You know that. And

563
00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:51.180
Franklin Dorsey: that's the only way. It is possible that I'm just not

564
00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:56.560
Franklin Dorsey: importing the data in the right way, because maybe we don't really need this

565
00:54:56.620 --> 00:55:03.950
Franklin Dorsey: relations here. And I could just import whole tables and just do the manipulation of the data in a different place.

566
00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:08.669
Franklin Dorsey: I agree it depending on. And I think it is situated.

567
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:24.599
Bob Jones: It's situationally dependent. And so sure let's put this on the parking lot, and we can. You and I can go through this. I'll better understand it. And but

568
00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:26.359
Franklin Dorsey: if you could.

569
00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:31.500
Franklin Dorsey: exactly, if you could modify this application to put back in

570
00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:41.290
Bob Jones: the lines that are generating the able error. Yes, I will do. That would be great, and what I'll do is I'll run it. I'll get that error.

571
00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:42.640
Bob Jones: and then

572
00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:46.460
Bob Jones: I'll just let you know quickly

573
00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:48.180
Bob Jones: whether I can

574
00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:51.180
Bob Jones: address it or I'll get someone to help me.

575
00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:52.650
Bob Jones: And just so you're,

576
00:55:52.800 --> 00:56:03.469
Bob Jones: so we're clear. It's, you know, if I get someone to help me, the hours that would be required would then be carved out of whatever time we have, so it wouldn't be.

577
00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:05.670
Bob Jones: Someone is coming in. And then.

578
00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:09.370
Bob Jones: you know, trying to impose new hours. It's just

579
00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:13.159
Bob Jones: I may delegate this just so I can stay focused on

580
00:56:13.330 --> 00:56:14.639
Bob Jones: other pieces.

581
00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:22.790
Franklin Dorsey: Sounds great. Yeah, good. Alright. Alright. So what I'd like to do is when it's convenient.

582
00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:24.240
Franklin Dorsey: if you can.

583
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:31.460
Bob Jones: I guess both. If I'm able to have the video is less important. The transcript would be very important to me.

584
00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:34.149
Bob Jones: and then I'll go through that

585
00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:38.820
Bob Jones: and over the next day I'm going to put together

586
00:56:39.450 --> 00:56:43.600
Bob Jones: a work plan based on what we've shared.

587
00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:46.589
Bob Jones: I would say this did

588
00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:49.990
Bob Jones: I think meeting at least once a day.

589
00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:54.229
Bob Jones: because this is such a short amount of time, it's going to be important.

590
00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:57.810
Bob Jones: So I think, at the at a minimum.

591
00:56:57.970 --> 00:57:01.579
Bob Jones: Well, I guess what would work for you every day this week

592
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:08.350
Bob Jones: for meeting? It doesn't have to be very long in terms of just every day we do a touch base

593
00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:11.980
Franklin Dorsey: Every weekday morning this week at 9:00 a.m. ET is a convenient time for me.

594
00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:13.620
Bob Jones: Perfect. Okay.

595
00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:16.250
Bob Jones: Yeah. So if

596
00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:25.260
Bob Jones: half an hour, probably. Yeah, it can be. Yes, we can use it as a stand up. And then if we decide, for instance,

597
00:57:25.410 --> 00:57:29.929
Bob Jones: we need to do a different meeting, for instance, to review what we just talked about,

598
00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:35.450
Bob Jones: then we don't need to do the scheduled daily 9:00 a.m. ET meeting that particular day. Because I just anticipate

599
00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:44.869
Bob Jones: that. I just want to make sure we're touching base every day. But let's yes, we'll see how we will do

600
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:58.699
Bob Jones: with the, with the booking data, because that's the most important thing. I will invite Amal to those meetings, so he will be able to explain you any details that you might have questions about regarding the booking data.

601
00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:08.390
Franklin Dorsey: and we'll see how it will go regarding the development. And if that's going to be necessary. We can have these those meetings, and if not.

602
00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:13.390
Franklin Dorsey: I'm not. I don't know if you think it is necessary, we can meet.

603
00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:17.299
Franklin Dorsey: Okay. So one of our one of our

604
00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:23.739
Franklin Dorsey: needs is also something like cooperation with you. So we will also understand.

605
00:58:23.850 --> 00:58:26.800
Franklin Dorsey: How are you going to do this? And maybe

606
00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:30.630
Franklin Dorsey: every day. Maybe that's a good idea. You would

607
00:58:30.750 --> 00:58:32.040
Franklin Dorsey: show us.

608
00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:38.329
Franklin Dorsey: How did you do stuff that that was done so we can also learn while you will be doing things.

609
00:58:38.790 --> 00:58:48.560
Bob Jones: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I think that's a great way to go as I'm looking now. I just opened up the Salesforce Data Connection. I'm looking at the tables and things.

610
00:58:49.094 --> 00:59:07.529
Bob Jones: Do I have access the applications I have access to? Will it be clear if the applications as well as the document you're gonna provide me? Will that give me what I need to get up to speed with the particular tables I need to be working with?

611
00:59:07.590 --> 00:59:13.720
Bob Jones: Or are all of the data I need to understand imported into the Booking Data Dashboard?

612
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.129
Franklin Dorsey: Everything that's needed to prepare the reports

613
00:59:18.737 --> 00:59:21.600
Franklin Dorsey: are based on the document

614
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:24.520
Franklin Dorsey: that I'm going to share with you. This is.

615
00:59:24.610 --> 00:59:28.540
Franklin Dorsey: I prepared this data set based on the

616
00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:29.780
Franklin Dorsey: export

617
00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:39.030
Franklin Dorsey: to spreadsheet that we are getting from Salesforce. So every data point that was in that spreadsheet is currently available in

618
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:46.769
Franklin Dorsey: Quiznos Analytics. And the document that you will receive from me is referring to those fields which are available in the

619
00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:48.750
Franklin Dorsey: Booking Data Dashboard Quiznos Analytics Sense application.

620
00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:54.550
Bob Jones: Okay, alright. Great. Okay. And I'm looking at the Booking Data Dashboard and I see,

621
00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:57.670
Bob Jones: on the 'Dev dashboard' Sheet,

622
00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:01.039
Bob Jones: eight KPI Visualization Objects.

623
01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:08.980
Franklin Dorsey: Exactly. Those are the numbers that I was trying to compare with a similar report from Salesforce.

624
01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:13.609
Franklin Dorsey: and we need to be perfectly sure

625
01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:16.729
Franklin Dorsey: that there are no discrepancies between the data displayed in Quest Enterprises's Salesforce system and the data displayed in Quest Enterprises's Quiznos Analytics Cloud Platform. So

626
01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:24.340
Franklin Dorsey: we must also be able every day to show you the numbers that we see in Quest Enterprises's Salesforce system

627
01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:27.250
Franklin Dorsey: and be able to tie out those numbers with the

628
01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:28.930
Franklin Dorsey: Quiznos Analytics Cloud Platform data.

629
01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:33.149
Franklin Dorsey: Currently, I am not able to achieve a 100%

630
01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:43.250
Franklin Dorsey: validation of the data from the Salesforce and Quiznos Analytics systems. There are some issues that we are aware about, like Currency Conversion Rates for the exchange for the various currency types contained in the Salesforce operational data tables,

631
01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:52.049
Franklin Dorsey: and probably some more issues. But that's something that Amal will be able to explain more. And but all of the things that

632
01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:56.669
Franklin Dorsey: should have been applied to this data set are in the document

633
01:00:56.890 --> 01:00:58.390
Franklin Dorsey: that I will send you after this call.

634
01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:01.560
Bob Jones: Right.

635
01:01:01.830 --> 01:01:04.440
Bob Jones: So good. So what I'll do

636
01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:09.410
Bob Jones: will be, you know. Take the transcript. I'll use that to assist me with

637
01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:16.719
Bob Jones: putting together a work plan and deliverables which we can go over tomorrow morning.

638
01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:22.179
Bob Jones: I'm gonna go through the Booking Data Dashboard application along with the document you'll send me

639
01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:24.419
Bob Jones: to understand the Measures used in the Quiznos Analytics Sense Booking Data Dashboard application.

640
01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:31.659
Bob Jones: And so would part of what you want to accomplish during this first week, or 'Phase One' objectives be for me to focus on the Booking Data Dashboard Quiznos Analytics Sense application and

641
01:01:32.186 --> 01:01:34.923
Bob Jones: work with you to lay out

642
01:01:35.610 --> 01:01:38.220
Bob Jones: a few Sheets populated with relevant Data Visualizations populated with the Measures contained in the document you're sending me?

643
01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:42.239
Franklin Dorsey: Yes, with a lot more than me. But yes, exactly.

644
01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:50.759
Bob Jones: Alright. And we know that with the Booking Data Dashboard, you're having issues with getting the data to tie out correctly

645
01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:52.750
Franklin Dorsey: and

646
01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:54.650
Bob Jones: and the thought.

647
01:01:54.780 --> 01:02:02.570
Bob Jones: So I think that's another one. And maybe that's during the session with them all is we can uncover. He can identify for me

648
01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:03.840
Bob Jones: which

649
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:09.339
Bob Jones: which data, elements or measures aren't tying out

650
01:02:09.743 --> 01:02:13.100
Bob Jones: with the Salesforce database. And then we can dig into that issue.

651
01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:24.390
Franklin Dorsey: Yes, I'm sure she will be able to point that out. We will be both on the call, so we will definitely be able to guide you, and we will find that. But

652
01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:26.429
Franklin Dorsey: I'm not able

653
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:35.240
Franklin Dorsey: to say what exactly is, is wrong with that. At this point we will have to try. The currencies will have to try

654
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:41.519
Franklin Dorsey: to make sure that the scope of the of the range of the dates is correct.

655
01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:50.429
Franklin Dorsey: If, yeah, there are couple of filters that are applied on the Salesforce side that I'm not sure if I was applying correctly in Quiznos Analytics.

656
01:02:50.530 --> 01:03:00.519
Bob Jones: Understood. When could you, Amal and I have an hour to have that meeting? Could we do that by the end of the day tomorrow, Tuesday, July 16, 2024?

657
01:03:01.850 --> 01:03:16.719
Franklin Dorsey: Most probably by the end of the day I'm not going to be available, because that's going to be very late for me. I'm based in Poland.

658
01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:23.030
Bob Jones: Oh, when I say end of day, I'm sorry. So could we, would it be possible to do tomorrow morning?

659
01:03:23.590 --> 01:03:24.559
Franklin Dorsey: I'll have like an hour
or 2

660
01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:28.480
Franklin Dorsey: till end of my day. So that's

661
01:03:28.550 --> 01:03:30.920
Franklin Dorsey: since I will have a call at

662
01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:32.690
Franklin Dorsey: 9:30 a.m. ET

663
01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:42.739
Franklin Dorsey: for an hour, or maybe not an hour. But that's like a team call. So I need to be there, sure I'm out will be free. So he will still be able to help you if you'll be available.

664
01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:48.963
Bob Jones: Yeah. And thank you first of all, pardon me for being ignorant about where you're located.

665
01:03:49.520 --> 01:04:07.479
Bob Jones: 1st of all, just cause I'll be very happy to. But secondly, just because this is a short duration. There's no problem with me taking an earlier call. If that gives you more breathing room. If you want to talk at 7 am Eastern and that makes your life easier. That's great with me. It's no problem.

666
01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:23.470
Franklin Dorsey: Yeah. So that's fine with me. But Amal is on the West coast? I think so. Alright. So yeah, I think if Amal is the priority in terms of this particular piece, the Booking Data Dashboard.

667
01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:31.180
Bob Jones: Then I would say, as soon as it's convenient for him. I'd like to get that done before the end of the day tomorrow.

668
01:04:31.617 --> 01:04:36.210
Franklin Dorsey: Let's. I will try to get him on a call

669
01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.340
Franklin Dorsey: tomorrow.

670
01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:38.680
Franklin Dorsey: and

671
01:04:38.740 --> 01:05:05.220
Franklin Dorsey: we will get together. We will meet each other, and you will be able to reach out to him at any time, and you will be able to agree anytime to work with him, because I'm not going to be needed for all the sessions. Okay, will be more interested. And looking at the visualizations, and we'll be able to provide a lot more information about the booking data and requirements for the visualizations. How

672
01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.760
Franklin Dorsey: he would want to

673
01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:09.480
Franklin Dorsey: see the

674
01:05:09.810 --> 01:05:15.350
Franklin Dorsey: slideshow source. Also how to say it. Or if he was using a specific word.

675
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:16.400
Franklin Dorsey: Okay.

676
01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:17.890
Franklin Dorsey: like a

677
01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:24.639
Franklin Dorsey: Storytelling. Exactly. So. He would want to have this kind of Storytelling possibility with couple of

678
01:05:25.649 --> 01:05:28.699
Franklin Dorsey: dashboards that will be going from a high level

679
01:05:28.830 --> 01:05:32.690
Franklin Dorsey: details to lower level details with some

680
01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:36.849
Franklin Dorsey: with some dig ins into the details for particular

681
01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.130
Franklin Dorsey: in

682
01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:43.519
Franklin Dorsey: visualization. So he will be able to explain all that.

683
01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:50.203
Bob Jones: Okay, yeah, that's perfect. And then I'm glad we have a chance to confirm that. So you feel free

684
01:05:50.730 --> 01:05:53.229
Bob Jones: to. Just if you want to move

685
01:05:53.490 --> 01:06:02.760
Bob Jones: to the time that we spend, whether it's the daily touching base or meetings where we're getting more into detail, feel free to move those earlier.

686
01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:05.630
Bob Jones: Okay, yeah, so yeah, just

687
01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:12.789
Bob Jones: just so, you know, let's okay. So that sounds great. So that's with them all for the booking dashboards.

688
01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:17.669
Bob Jones: The service. Now, Connector. Once I hear from you, I'll know that

689
01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:23.719
Bob Jones: I can go into the ETR Dashboard Application, replicate that error on my own.

690
01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:28.879
Bob Jones: and then decide whether I handle it or I pass that off.

691
01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:32.480
Bob Jones: I delegate that so that it can be done more efficiently.

692
01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:37.919
Bob Jones: and I feel comfortable that we're on the same page in terms of

693
01:06:38.250 --> 01:06:40.909
Bob Jones: that 3rd piece, the training piece.

694
01:06:41.407 --> 01:06:46.060
Bob Jones: Alright, so say when we meet tomorrow morning I'll have that outline

695
01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:50.020
Bob Jones: for how we want to accomplish, you know, how we want to spend the entire eighty billable hours allocated for this engagement.

696
01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:51.175
Bob Jones: And

697
01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:56.039
Bob Jones: I'll rely on you in terms of

698
01:06:57.020 --> 01:07:03.199
Bob Jones: the, for instance, what we had looked at just a moment ago before, issues with data models,

699
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:06.840
Bob Jones: the circular reference and things.

700
01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:11.810
Bob Jones: If that's something that specific, either we use it as a used case for
