WEBVTT

1
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.230
Filip Hanaczewski: And it's recording alright perfect.

2
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.840
Arthur Fantaci: Yeah. So we'll take this transcript, having covered each of those elements.

3
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.590
Arthur Fantaci: And then my plan is just to

4
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.560
Arthur Fantaci: use Qlik Answers to

5
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.580
Arthur Fantaci: make our lives easier, to generate

6
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.930
Arthur Fantaci: a draft document that

7
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.579
Arthur Fantaci: well, then, we can just touch it up over the course of the 2 weeks, and at the end.

8
00:00:39.626 --> 00:00:41.770
Filip Hanaczewski: That sounds great.

9
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:57.778
Arthur Fantaci: Yeah, so good. All right. I would love unless you're would you rather go through the questions first, or do you want to go through your project plan? First, let's go through the questions. Let's get the formalities first. Okay? Sounds good. Let me.

10
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.330
Arthur Fantaci: I'm gonna pull up my

11
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.919
Arthur Fantaci: email just to go through each of the

12
00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.560
Arthur Fantaci: individual questions.

13
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.400
Arthur Fantaci: Okay, great. So

14
00:01:12.917 --> 00:01:25.000
Arthur Fantaci: we'll just go through them in in turn. So the first question is the Company Name. Is Percona the entire company name, or is it Percona Inc. or is there a different name? The next question is Company Industry.

15
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.540
Arthur Fantaci: What is Percona's Industry?

16
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.189
Filip Hanaczewski: It's databases services.

17
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.670
Arthur Fantaci: Okay, thanks. I was not familiar with Percona, but

18
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.280
Arthur Fantaci: now I am, and I'm glad to know

19
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:49.589
Arthur Fantaci: The next question is Company Location. Where is Percona located?

20
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.885
Filip Hanaczewski: The Percona company headquarters is located in Raleigh, North Carolina, United States.

21
00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:09.410
Arthur Fantaci: Okay. And the next question is Company Contact. I'm assuming you and I will be working together, and that you, Filip Hanaczewski, are the Company Contact. The next question is the Company Contact Role.
22
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.579
Filip Hanaczewski: Yes, I am the correct person to list as the Company Contact.

23
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.509
Filip Hanaczewski: My title is Senior Business Systems Analyst, and my title should be listed as the Company Contact Role.

24
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:30.539
Arthur Fantaci: Alright, thank you, Filip. Let's begin discussing the purpose of this project we're here today to kick off? What activities will Qlik Professional Services be performing and what deliverables will Qlik Professional Services be delivering for Percona during the course of this project?

25
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.959
Filip Hanaczewski: Okay, so

26
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.979
Filip Hanaczewski: our plan is to get data and analytics

27
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.669
Filip Hanaczewski: adopted in Percona because we are really struggling with it.

28
00:02:41.784 --> 00:02:47.469
Filip Hanaczewski: The plan is to make the data and analytics like Business Intelligence tool and

29
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.460
Filip Hanaczewski: data literacy data cataloging more

30
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.290
Filip Hanaczewski: available and approachable

31
00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:02.830
Filip Hanaczewski: for the entire company. Percona will start small. There will be just few people that will be starting with Qlik

32
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.850
Filip Hanaczewski: to use it, and then we will propagate the knowledge

33
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.500
Filip Hanaczewski: to a wider audience.

34
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.470
Filip Hanaczewski: 1st of all, we will want to create some trainings

35
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.990
Filip Hanaczewski: based on your experience based on Qlik's

36
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.120
Filip Hanaczewski: learning resources.

37
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.310
Filip Hanaczewski: That's what we will want to bring to Percona

38
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.359
Filip Hanaczewski: with this Qlik Professional Services engagement.

39
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.080
Filip Hanaczewski: And the

40
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.119
Filip Hanaczewski: deliverables that we are thinking, like the measurable things that we want to get out of this Professional Services engagement

41
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:46.700
Filip Hanaczewski: are, first off, the Booking Data Dashboard that will be available for the Percona Finance Team. Secondly, the Percona Revenue Operations Team, as well as the wider audience

42
00:03:48.086 --> 00:03:53.364
Filip Hanaczewski: connected to Percona's ServiceNow data. I am having a problem with the Qlik ServiceNow Data Connector. The

43
00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:05.030
Filip Hanaczewski: out-of-the-box Qlik ServiceNow Data Connector doesn't work properly, and I'm struggling with the API. So that's the second thing. And the third thing is Training Materials. Preparation of Training Materials is the third

44
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.840
Filip Hanaczewski: goal, together with the

45
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.300
Filip Hanaczewski: with Data Catalog preparation. So,

46
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.250
Filip Hanaczewski: we want to have a set of information for new users that will be

47
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:35.380
Filip Hanaczewski: joining Percona's Qlik Cloud Platform and will be able to use the tool, and we want to address them with the Training Materials first, and then we would want to provide them access to some type of Data Catalog, so they will be able to see what kind of data sets do they have, what kind of data is in those data sets, and what kinds of

48
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.300
Filip Hanaczewski: Data Visualizations or Qlik Dashboards we already have.

49
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:47.029
Filip Hanaczewski: This kind of stuff is the 3rd goal and is the least important at this point, but I would want to address it, also, if we'll have time.

50
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:54.830
Arthur Fantaci: Okay, thank you. Yeah. In 99% of my

51
00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:07.130
Arthur Fantaci: experiences with engagements of this kind, no one is able to articulate as clearly as you just did what they want to get out of the engagement. So this is terrific, and I embrace your third point

52
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:15.440
Arthur Fantaci: because it's soon enough that the first two priorities will be met, and then ongoing you'll be left with needing to meet your third priority of how to onboard

53
00:05:16.145 --> 00:05:21.050
Arthur Fantaci: new users to the Qlik Cloud Platform, as well as foster their productive use of the platform. So,

54
00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:25.014
Arthur Fantaci: what we can do over the next day is

55
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.100
Arthur Fantaci: brainstorm and

56
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:35.710
Arthur Fantaci: scope out what we need to get done, and then prioritize those items and identify what we can actually get done within this engagement's allowable time. So at a minimum for the third point,

57
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:42.030
Arthur Fantaci: you and I can work together to make sure that we at least have a framework, if not,

58
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:49.310
Arthur Fantaci: you know, specific deliverables for that 3rd objective of Training, Onboarding, and those kinds of activities.

59
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.480
Filip Hanaczewski: Excellent.

60
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:51.580
Arthur Fantaci: Okay.

61
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.639
Arthur Fantaci: Yeah, Training, Onboarding, and those kinds of activities have been a real interest of mine over the last few years.

62
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.462
Arthur Fantaci: I digress a bit here, but

63
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.170
Arthur Fantaci: how do you put

64
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.710
Arthur Fantaci: that type of

65
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.903
Arthur Fantaci: resource into a in a digestible

66
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.352
Arthur Fantaci: medium, so that people actually use it, you know.

67
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.560
Arthur Fantaci: So yeah. So I'm glad to have that third point be a part of this engagement.

68
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.219
Arthur Fantaci: Okay, that was terrific. And

69
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.100
Arthur Fantaci: all right. So let's talk about the solution. Some of these points. Clearly, we won't

70
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:34.649
Arthur Fantaci: be, or I won't, because you won't have to draft any of this, but I'll be grateful for your oversight and

71
00:06:35.281 --> 00:06:39.699
Arthur Fantaci: approval of the content.

72
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.480
Arthur Fantaci: In terms of the solutions we deliver during this engagement, is Percona on

73
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.110
Arthur Fantaci: the Qlik Windows Enterprise platform or the Qlik Cloud platform?

74
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.690
Filip Hanaczewski: Percona is on the Qlik Cloud platform.
75
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.729
Arthur Fantaci: That's great. Okay, good. Is Percona using any of the Qlik Data Integration

76
00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:06.040
Arthur Fantaci: components of the Qlik Cloud platform? Or is this engagement focused entirely on Qlik Cloud Analytics and Qlik Sense application development? Because I did, thank you very much, get access right away to Percona's Qlik Cloud Tenant

77
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.840
Arthur Fantaci: from the link you provided me. So this engagement will be focused on Qlik Cloud Analytics and Qlik Sense

78
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.259
Arthur Fantaci: in terms of the tools and components we'll be using. Okay, yeah.

79
00:07:15.876 --> 00:07:36.470
Filip Hanaczewski: Yes, Qlik Sense. Well, Qlik Cloud, I'm not sure of the naming of the specific Qlik product that Percona has licensed from Qlik. But I think Qlik Sense. But it's the Qlik Cloud Platform version of Qlik Sense, and we don't have any specific Qlik product components or integrations added to Percona's Qlik Cloud Platform. I was recently talking with Qlik Talend about the Qlik Cloud Data Integration products and capabilities, because Percona is also looking at the Qlik Cloud version of the Qlik Data Integration Platform as an additional piece of the Qlik Cloud Platform to license from Qlik.

80
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.630
Filip Hanaczewski: But Percona hasn't made any decisions or affirmative steps around licensing any components of the Qlik Data Integration Platform. So Percona

81
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:49.750
Filip Hanaczewski: just has the Qlik Cloud instance that you got invited to log into as a user. Please let me know if you are missing any privileges to see something more, because we don't have much implemented in our Qlik Cloud instance yet. If there would be something more that you need, just let me know, and I'll change it.

82
00:07:49.760 --> 00:08:05.999
Arthur Fantaci: Oh, that's great. I appreciate that. So after we've ended this first meeting, I'll go drive around the Percona Qlik Cloud instance and take a look. I'm laughing because

83
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:13.290
Arthur Fantaci: you can join the club in terms of confusion about Qlik's product naming conventions. It's the same for me. Things

84
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:19.190
Arthur Fantaci: things change so quickly. So you articulated it beautifully. So there's none of the Talend Qlik Data Integration

85
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:27.748
Arthur Fantaci: components. And we're just gonna be working right on the Percona Qlik Cloud Tenant. So that's perfect.

86
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:34.999
Arthur Fantaci: All right, and let me look at the next question, Product and Service Use. We've already talked about the Implementation Process question. So now let's

87
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:39.099
Arthur Fantaci: discuss my activities and deliverables for next day or so. After I complete those activities and deliverables, we can plan to meet

88
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:42.150
Arthur Fantaci: and we'll walk through what I think would be,

89
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:49.160
Arthur Fantaci: I hope, an acceptable work plan and how we'll get things done for the duration of this current engagement.

90
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:52.959
Arthur Fantaci: So that's the solution piece for now:

91
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:59.499
Arthur Fantaci: the Engagement Outline document, as well as the details and timelines of this engagement. So we know, today's date, Monday, July 14, 2024 will be the answer to the 'Start Date' question.

92
00:08:59.886 --> 00:09:10.950
Arthur Fantaci: And with this engagement budgeted for eighty hours, we know the answer to the 'End Date' question will be Friday, July 26, 2024. And the answers to some of these questions aren't set in stone. For instance, we have a set block of eighty billable hours.

93
00:09:11.418 --> 00:09:14.420
Arthur Fantaci: My way of working is,

94
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:34.470
Arthur Fantaci: you know, we'll make sure we get down on paper and agree very quickly about what we want to get done in the eighty hours of billable time. But if it takes a few hours extra here or there, that's irrelevant. It's not going to be, "I've burned through my allotted hours, and now I'll stop working" or something like that.

95
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:45.399
Arthur Fantaci: To answer the 'Engagement Team' question, let's just list out the individuals from Percona and Qlik that we envision participating in this engagement, and also, for instance, any relevant Project Stakeholders.

96
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:52.149
Arthur Fantaci: I know this isn't a very big project. But if there are other people that aren't direct members of the 'Engagement Team', like, for instance, Approvers or Steering Committee members, if you will.

97
00:09:52.230 --> 00:10:02.429
Arthur Fantaci: Identifying those types of individuals will assist in answering the question about 'Milestones' because if those individuals need to be apprised over the course of this engagement, and you know what information we would need to provide them, we can create specific 'Milestones' to document those requirements.

98
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.209
Filip Hanaczewski: Okay. So our plan was to

99
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:11.039
Filip Hanaczewski: get the engagement with the Qlik Professional Services Team, or you, Arthur Fantaci, specifically

100
00:10:11.487 --> 00:10:25.409
Filip Hanaczewski: for about a week and work with you on the most problematic things: the issue with the Qlik ServiceNow Data Connector; the Percona Booking Data Qlik Sense application (i.e., Booking Data Dashboard), specifically the data and initial dashboard preparation based on the data that is already imported into Percona's Qlik Cloud platform.

101
00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:37.962
Filip Hanaczewski: Because I was able to prepare the data set for the Booking Data Dashboard. It's not perfect. We will talk about it in upcoming calls we need to schedule, probably during the calls we schedule to discuss the scope of the Booking Data Dashboard development.

102
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:43.120
Filip Hanaczewski: The thing is, that Percona would want to have like a week-long initial engagement

103
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.760
Filip Hanaczewski: first,

104
00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:52.760
Filip Hanaczewski: where we will see what was done by Qlik Professional Services, and then we would want to pause this engagement for an indeterminate period to allow Percona to get acquainted with that specific work and deliverables.

105
00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:53.950
Filip Hanaczewski: And after that pause, Percona would want re-engage with Qlik Professional Services, with some more questions, and resume the engagement for the remaining duration of forty billable hours.

106
00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:14.920
Filip Hanaczewski: What we don't understand, but we will not be able to reproduce ourselves, because we don't understand some pieces of it, and then we would want to get the like. The second week of this engagement. If that makes sense for the activities and deliverables necessary to address the Training and Data Cataloging areas of interest. And all of this area encompassing the

107
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.730
Filip Hanaczewski: Data Governance piece, as well as

108
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:21.610
Filip Hanaczewski: more questions and so on. I'm not sure if

109
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.749
Filip Hanaczewski: one week, this first week will be enough

110
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:32.559
Filip Hanaczewski: to deliver the Booking Data Dashboard and resolve the issue with the Qlik ServiceNow Data Connector, enabling access to the ServiceNow data and integration with the ServiceNow database.

111
00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:45.099
Filip Hanaczewski: If that will be not enough, we can take more time. But Percona would want to get some break in the middle, so we can get acquainted with what was done and get back to Qlik Professional Services with questions.

112
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.660
Filip Hanaczewski: Okay.

113
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:51.899
Filip Hanaczewski: So that's like the overall timeline

114
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:58.230
Filip Hanaczewski: that we see. There are no hard deadlines for Percona for when this needs to be done.

115
00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.249
Filip Hanaczewski: And the answer to the 'Engagement Team' question will be me

116
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.280
Filip Hanaczewski: and my director, Eduardo Casareo.

117
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:14.699
Filip Hanaczewski: Eduardo Casareo will be the decision maker, probably with any need to increase the number of Qlik Professional Service's billable hours or any additional engagements with Qlik Professional Services. If either of those contingencies were going to happen.

118
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:19.989
Filip Hanaczewski: And the other member of the 'Engagement Team' from Percona will be Amal Naik, from the Percona Finance Team.

119
00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:34.299
Filip Hanaczewski: Amal Naik is a Senior Financial Analyst with Percona. Amal Naik is the primary stakeholder of the Booking Data Dashboard. Amal will be maintaining the Booking Data Dashboard, changing it, and improving it, based on the requirements he receives from other Percona Finance Team Stakeholders.

120
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.410
Filip Hanaczewski: And another member of the 'Engagement Team' but

121
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:40.989
Filip Hanaczewski: less involved, will be Shannon Lastname.

122
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.859
Filip Hanaczewski: Shannon Lastname is Amal Naik's

123
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.120
Filip Hanaczewski: manager. And the final member of the 'Engagement Team' from Percona is this engagement's

124
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:48.199
Filip Hanaczewski: sponsor, Eileen Bigwig.

125
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.260
Filip Hanaczewski: That's like the whole team from Percona that will be working on this small project, and each of their names should be added as responses to the 'Engagement Team' question.

126
00:12:54.100 --> 00:13:08.039
Arthur Fantaci: Okay, that's perfect, and what we can do is one thing I love about using, recording the meeting and using the transcript is, I'll come back to you just to confirm spellings and titles for the folks we just talked about.

127
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:32.629
Arthur Fantaci: So we don't have to worry about it right now, and agreed. So from Qlik Professional Services, the names that should be added as responses to the 'Engagement Team' question are: Arthur Fantaci and Mark Vincze. So I'll give you just the quick version of my background. So my name is Arthur Fantaci and I've been with Qlik for the past six years. I've been working with the Qlik platform for over 10 years. I've been focused on Qlik Sense for the last

128
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.789
Arthur Fantaci: 5 or 6 years.

129
00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.729
Arthur Fantaci: I tend to

130
00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.730
Arthur Fantaci: focus on the Data Modeling process all the way

131
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:45.079
Arthur Fantaci: into Dashboard design

132
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:48.119
Arthur Fantaci: and creation, as well as

133
00:13:48.932 --> 00:13:51.830
Arthur Fantaci: the more recent

134
00:13:52.591 --> 00:13:56.168
Arthur Fantaci: features in the Qlik Cloud Platform, like

135
00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:03.329
Arthur Fantaci: Qlik Alerting. Or, for instance, the Qlik Answers product launch is coming up. So I've spent the last month

136
00:14:04.045 --> 00:14:08.509
Arthur Fantaci: getting up to speed on the pre-release version of that product.

137
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:16.299
Arthur Fantaci: I have about 25 plus years in this Business Intelligence game.

138
00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:18.060
Arthur Fantaci: And that's my background.

139
00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.910
Filip Hanaczewski: We are very excited to begin this engagement.

140
00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.480
Filip Hanaczewski: I see

141
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.149
Filip Hanaczewski: we are in good hands.

142
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:35.450
Arthur Fantaci: I hope so. I very much enjoy what I do. This engagement appears to present a lot of opportunity to build a great foundation. I'll also be supported by

143
00:14:35.809 --> 00:14:53.439
Arthur Fantaci: the Qlik Professional Services folks that you've been on the phone with during your previous calls this past April and June. So, for instance, Mark Vincze, is someone who, one of the people I would report up into and he's in management of Qlik Professional Services, but he has many years under his belt of delivering Qlik implementations

144
00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.899
Arthur Fantaci: and Lance Anderson

145
00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:10.940
Arthur Fantaci: again, also from a platform implementation and maintenance. And obviously because I'm with Qlik, I have access to resources. So if there are questions that come up along the way, and then also

146
00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.780
Arthur Fantaci: I can give you, I'm happy to provide

147
00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:22.609
Arthur Fantaci: advice about how to navigate Qlik as an organization. So you know, in terms of support.

148
00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.769
Arthur Fantaci: getting previews or access or things like that without

149
00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:41.489
Arthur Fantaci: they basically skipping, skipping the line. So alright, and I think we've talked pretty well about. So I appreciate the you sharing the team from your side. Based our conversation thus far, I think we've answered the 'Overview' question.

150
00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:45.540
Arthur Fantaci: Alright, let's discuss how to answer the 'Post Implementation' question.

151
00:15:46.340 --> 00:16:04.659
Arthur Fantaci: I guess this would be a good time. So for key milestones and post implementation, which we can kind of consider post implementation, a milestone as well. I understand what you shared with me about. We want to see what we want to see, what we can get done in a 40 h block.

152
00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:09.909
Arthur Fantaci: and then provide an opportunity for you all

153
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.459
Arthur Fantaci: to digest what has been delivered.

154
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:19.840
Arthur Fantaci: and then come back with another block. Ideally 40 h

155
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.524
Arthur Fantaci: to address what comes up during that

156
00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.679
Arthur Fantaci: break period.

157
00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.320
Filip Hanaczewski: That's super!

158
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:36.260
Arthur Fantaci: Okay? So I think kind of naturally, then, would be, for instance, a Milestone would be the end of this, the end of the 1st block.

159
00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:38.530
Arthur Fantaci: The beginning of the

160
00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:40.600
Arthur Fantaci: second block

161
00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.430
Arthur Fantaci: which would largely be

162
00:16:44.417 --> 00:16:47.502
Arthur Fantaci: you and your colleagues presenting

163
00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.640
Arthur Fantaci: what you want to get out of the second

164
00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:53.379
Arthur Fantaci: block of time,

165
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.866
Arthur Fantaci: and then

166
00:16:55.790 --> 00:17:01.009
Arthur Fantaci: a meeting or review at the end of that second 40 hours.

167
00:17:03.365 --> 00:17:08.139
Arthur Fantaci: And so one thing I can think of for this week, or say over the next 24

168
00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:11.560
Arthur Fantaci: to 48 hours would be for you and I

169
00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:13.529
Arthur Fantaci: to create some sort

170
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.990
Arthur Fantaci: of work plan

171
00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.640
Arthur Fantaci: for this 1st block,

172
00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:33.259
Arthur Fantaci: and what we anticipate currently for the second block, because we don't quite know what you're going to get, but I feel like, perhaps by the end of the day tomorrow, Tuesday, July 16, 2024 or before noon on Wednesday, July 17, 2024.

173
00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:35.900
Arthur Fantaci: we're gonna want to

174
00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.089
Arthur Fantaci: agree on and create a Phase One Work Plan Document that details what are we delivering

175
00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.310
Arthur Fantaci: this week

176
00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.610
Arthur Fantaci: in terms of whether we'll have enough time to

177
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:49.829
Arthur Fantaci: fix the Qlik ServiceNow Data Connector,

178
00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.749
Arthur Fantaci: how much can we get built out of the Booking Data Dashboard,

179
00:17:55.244 --> 00:18:05.109
Arthur Fantaci: and then for the Training Material? And I know it sounds a little silly that the Engagement's Phase One will only be 5 days long, and we wouldn't review a first draft of the Phase One Work Plan Document until the end of the Engagement's Phase One second day or the beginning of the Engagement's Phase One third day.

180
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.099
Arthur Fantaci: Does that make sense that within the next

181
00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:18.490
Arthur Fantaci: day and a half to 2 days we draft a Phase One Work Plan Document? I'll draft the initial Phase One Work Plan Document that we can review and agree that it contains

182
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.700
Arthur Fantaci: an accurate depiction of our Engagement Roadmap or Engagement Work Plan for delivery of Engagement Phase One activities and deliverables. Do you agree with that approach, Filip?

183
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:29.522
Filip Hanaczewski: All right. Great. That sounds good, and so I don't really know about in terms of the break how we incorporate that into the current Engagement.

184
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:38.870
Arthur Fantaci: The beauty of being the client is you're the client, so we'll figure out how to make this work. And another reason, I think it's important that we

185
00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:52.571
Arthur Fantaci: document these kinds of things. If whatever reason, I'm not the person who is working with you at the second piece. I anticipate I will be. But if there's a break we'll just need to make sure about that.

186
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:56.189
Arthur Fantaci: We'll make sure there won't be any hiccups or

187
00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:57.770
Arthur Fantaci: learning curve if a different Qlik Professional Services Consultant is assigned to complete the Engagement's second half (i.e., Phase Two).

188
00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:02.040
Arthur Fantaci: Alright. So that sounds good for the Engagement's

189
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.079
Filip Hanaczewski: 'Results and Achievements' question. Obviously.

190
00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.519
Arthur Fantaci: I think this would be more of.

191
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:12.019
Arthur Fantaci: You've shared with me. What your objectives are

192
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.070
Arthur Fantaci: in relation to providing the details to answer the 'Quantifiable

193
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:16.920
Arthur Fantaci: Improvements' question.

194
00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:24.159
Arthur Fantaci: I believe 'Quantifiable Improvements' would be described as improvements

195
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:31.900
Arthur Fantaci: over Percona's state of operations prior to implementing it's Qlik Cloud Platform and the completion of this engagement. We don't need to be slavishly thorough here. But are there things just

196
00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.810
Arthur Fantaci: off the top of your head that

197
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:40.040
Arthur Fantaci: you're associating with Percona achieving the three things we talked about earlier.

198
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:44.179
Filip Hanaczewski: Yes, that's exactly how we can put it.

199
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:53.389
Filip Hanaczewski: If we accomplish the three things we talked about earlier, Percona will get a Booking Data Dashboard with reports and associated functionality at the end of the Engagement's entire eighty-hour block of billable hours.

200
00:19:53.520 --> 00:20:00.059
Filip Hanaczewski: And Percona will have no further questions, and will understand how to start maintaining and improving the Booking Data Dashboard.

201
00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.649
Filip Hanaczewski: That's a 'Quantifiable Improvement' associated with achieving the first of the three things we discussed earlier during this conversation.

202
00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.190
Filip Hanaczewski: That will be a measurable result for Percona.

203
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:13.089
Filip Hanaczewski: The second measurable result will be resolving the current issue preventing Percona's use of the Qlik ServiceNow Data Connector: If the Qlik ServiceNow Data Connector will be working for the ServiceNow data

204
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:20.259
Filip Hanaczewski: that we want to begin importing into Qlik Sense, and we are able to understand

205
00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.660
Filip Hanaczewski: how to write the connection

206
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:23.120
Filip Hanaczewski: for the next

207
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:31.700
Filip Hanaczewski: data sets that we will want to put in. That's another measurable achievement for Percona.

208
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:40.699
Filip Hanaczewski: The third 'Quantifiable Improvement' will be the creation of a Data Catalogue or Data Catalogue for the Percona Teams using the Qlik Cloud Platform. And Percona knowing how to improve the Data Catalogue and

209
00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:44.080
Filip Hanaczewski: and use it productively. That achievement would be the 3rd thing.

210
00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:55.619
Arthur Fantaci: Okay, and when you say Data Catalog, are you referring specifically to the Qlik Data Catalog component? Or are you using the term 'Data Catalogue' in the generic sense?

211
00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:21.490
Filip Hanaczewski: I am using the term 'Data Catalog' more generically. I'm using it more generically. We would want to introduce, like kind of a Data Catalog as a concept in Percona. In general, we do not have. I think we do not have the Qlik Data Catalog product if that's an actual Qlik product. So when I refer to a Data Catalog, I'm thinking about a place where people would be able to just go in, see what's available and

212
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:27.730
Filip Hanaczewski: read about this a bit to understand the data points that are there, and just make sure that

213
00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:29.570
Filip Hanaczewski: they know what

214
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.170
Filip Hanaczewski: they can do with it.

215
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:41.219
Arthur Fantaci: Okay, I understand what you are saying,

216
00:21:42.096 --> 00:21:42.803
Arthur Fantaci: and

217
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:52.700
Arthur Fantaci:  we can come up with an initial scalable Data Catalog solution that you could implement just within Percona's existing Qlik Cloud Platform, using Qlik Sense. So, for instance,

218
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:58.270
Arthur Fantaci: whether it's within individual dashboards having one sheet

219
00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.360
Arthur Fantaci: that provides a catalog

220
00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.649
Arthur Fantaci: of the dimensions and measures.

221
00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.920
Arthur Fantaci: with more with metadata associated

222
00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.119
Arthur Fantaci: with those elements,

223
00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.659
Arthur Fantaci: even rolling up the details for easy investigation.

224
00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.950
Arthur Fantaci: So one, I think one step would be, you know.

225
00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:29.040
Arthur Fantaci: at the individual application or dashboard level within boiling it up so that that information would be centralized so that the maintenance of it.

226
00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:35.609
Arthur Fantaci: So, for instance, the Percona Finance Team Members using Qlik Sense could have, or will have ownership of that, so it won't be

227
00:22:36.882 --> 00:22:39.080
Arthur Fantaci: it is struggling

228
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:44.679
Arthur Fantaci: to try and read minds or chase people to see if things have been updated. So

229
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:48.109
Arthur Fantaci: okay, yeah, and understood

230
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:52.600
Arthur Fantaci: alright. And so I think that covers that beautifully.

231
00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:58.080
Arthur Fantaci: Okay, now let's discuss the question 'Adoption Usage'. I think the answer to this question will be pretty straightforward. As you said, Qlik Cloud is a new

232
00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:05.250
Arthur Fantaci: platform for Percona. So we should just be able to use

233
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:08.800
Arthur Fantaci: the existing Qlik Sense Administration Monitoring

234
00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:14.279
Arthur Fantaci: dashboard to measure New User rates

235
00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.000
Arthur Fantaci: as well as System Usage Rates by multiple dimensions.

236
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.960
Arthur Fantaci: Additionally,

237
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:27.579
Arthur Fantaci: I can show you how to easily access the data populating that dashboard if for whatever reason you want to build a separate dashboard

238
00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:30.620
Arthur Fantaci: or extend that dashboard group.

239
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:32.469
Filip Hanaczewski: Excellent. Yes.

240
00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:35.669
Arthur Fantaci: Okay, great alright. And

241
00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:42.979
Arthur Fantaci: let's see. So we've attempted to answer the 'Results and Achievements' question, and we've also attempted to answer the 'Adoption and Usage' question. That brings us to the 'Financial Impact' question.

242
00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:50.120
Arthur Fantaci: To answer the 'Financial Impact' question we need to calculate Percona's anticipated Return on Investment (ROI).

243
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:54.249
Arthur Fantaci: Do you have thoughts about whether Percona is anticipating a positive Return on Investment from this engagement, and if there are specific use cases we can identify and use

244
00:23:54.630 --> 00:24:00.350
Arthur Fantaci: to measure and report the Return on Investment

245
00:24:01.417 --> 00:24:06.919
Arthur Fantaci: anticipated from successfully completing this engagement?

246
00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:13.390
Filip Hanaczewski: It will be time saving definitely because we are trying to move

247
00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:18.020
Filip Hanaczewski: this this small project. Let's call it a Proof of Concept (POC) of Qlik

248
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:23.389
Filip Hanaczewski: should be like a guidance for bigger teams

249
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:28.380
Filip Hanaczewski: to start adopting Qlik. And with this engagement

250
00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:31.320
Filip Hanaczewski: we will not see a lot of improvement.

251
00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:43.350
Filip Hanaczewski: it will be because Amal will be offloaded from the manual things that he would have to do on the spreadsheet and importing data and changing in data manually.

252
00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:51.730
Filip Hanaczewski: but and of course, the way that the visualizations will be prepared would be much easier to understand and

253
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:55.250
Filip Hanaczewski: beautiful, not like we have now.

254
00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.730
Filip Hanaczewski: So that's

255
00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:01.870
Filip Hanaczewski: like minimal level that we will go with. But the next step will be

256
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:10.579
Filip Hanaczewski: to decrease the number of time that people are spend spending on preparation of any kind of reports that

257
00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:15.200
Filip Hanaczewski: we have in the Revenue Operations Team, for example, or in

258
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:26.390
Filip Hanaczewski: and in the wider Financial Team or in Marketing. Maybe this. They are all connected with spreadsheets,

259
00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:33.770
Filip Hanaczewski: and with exporting and importing data. Everything is in different places. So it's hard to find. It's not

260
00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:36.770
Filip Hanaczewski: unified between the teams. So

261
00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:44.389
Filip Hanaczewski: if we will be able to adopt Qlik in all of those teams, it's going to be a time saver, and so resulting in cost savings.

262
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:57.116
Arthur Fantaci: That's perfect. I appreciate it. I do want to apologize. I'm about to get up and take a toy away from my dog, Sadie, which I'm not sure if you can hear the squeaking she's making from playing with the toy.

263
00:25:58.321 --> 00:26:05.700
Filip Hanaczewski: I also have one, my son, just my son just woke him up. So

264
00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:07.240
Filip Hanaczewski: it's the same thing, I guess.

265
00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:19.410
Arthur Fantaci: So. Yeah, that sounds like we're in the same boat here. Thank you for that. That is very helpful. It raises one question for me, which is in terms of dashboard development.

266
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.870
Arthur Fantaci: Upfront initially or moving forward.

267
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:31.369
Arthur Fantaci: How will the Qlik Sense dashboards be built? Will Percona have a team of Qlik Sense Application Developers who'll be building those dashboards based on requirements

268
00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:35.509
Arthur Fantaci: from end users? Or is the Qlik Sense dashboard development going to be blended where you're going to be

269
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:40.890
Arthur Fantaci: empowering end users to create their own dashboards.

270
00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:51.769
Filip Hanaczewski: More of the second approach. I will be like a Data Engineer Architect that will be bringing the data in, together with the Data Stewards.

271
00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:56.650
Filip Hanaczewski: I'll be preparing the data sets, and then the Data Stewards,

272
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.280
Filip Hanaczewski: or particular

273
00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:04.919
Filip Hanaczewski: Percona Department Teams will be responsible for preparation of the

274
00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:09.089
Filip Hanaczewski: of the Qlik Sense dashboard visualizations. That's why we would want to develop

275
00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:14.079
Filip Hanaczewski: this kind of Training Material we've been discussing, that will simplify the learning curve for them.

276
00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:24.220
Filip Hanaczewski: We will also, me and Amal will be like the guidance for the newcomers, and we will help them adopt and understand how to use Qlik Sense.

277
00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:31.539
Arthur Fantaci: So that's very helpful. What I would foresee is that

278
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:33.350
Arthur Fantaci: we will have

279
00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:40.630
Arthur Fantaci: two different segments of Qlik Users across Percona.

280
00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:54.959
Arthur Fantaci: I would see the priority being, and forgive me because I don't know enough about your background. But we would want to make sure that there's a structure around how Qlik Data Models are created. So

281
00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:01.340
Arthur Fantaci: I would see if you're gonna have end users creating the front end, which is

282
00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:06.929
Arthur Fantaci: which is great. I mean, that product is, you know, kind of architected for that.

283
00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.564
Arthur Fantaci: You'd wanna have

284
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:13.720
Arthur Fantaci: a library of data models.

285
00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:19.270
Arthur Fantaci: That would be plug and play if you will, or

286
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:22.620
Arthur Fantaci: for instance, beginning with QVDs.

287
00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:27.149
Arthur Fantaci: then Qlik Sense applications that contain Qlik Data Models

288
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.604
Arthur Fantaci: that could then just be

289
00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:34.080
Arthur Fantaci: attached, if you will, to a new Qlik Sense

290
00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:42.769
Arthur Fantaci: application. And so the end user would never have to think about what Data Model they're using. All they're doing is just focusing on

291
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.110
Arthur Fantaci: creating visualizations based on known dimensions and measures.

292
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:54.980
Arthur Fantaci: So, yeah, that's that sounds exactly how you would want to approach this.

293
00:28:55.586 --> 00:29:12.230
Filip Hanaczewski: If there will be some missing pieces in the data sets. I would expect the Data Stewards to come to me, and we will work out the changes that should have been done on the data sets that are connected to the, to the Data Models, to the Qlik Sense applications.

294
00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:27.880
Filip Hanaczewski: Okay, I understand what it is. But I'm trying to learn it. And I would appreciate your help with it. If we will be using any of these during this engagement, I would be happy to see it.

295
00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:37.039
Arthur Fantaci: Yeah, absolutely. So I think what we could do is we can use the Booking Data Dashboard as a Use Case, if you will.

296
00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:41.620
Filip Hanaczewski: Excellent for best practice for that so, for instance.

297
00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:54.069
Filip Hanaczewski: the best practice would be something approximating a 3 tiered architecture, which is a very fancy way of saying a base layer of

298
00:29:55.292 --> 00:30:06.867
Filip Hanaczewski: where you would say import tables as a select star, and you would import those, let's say, on a daily basis. Each table would be

299
00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:11.480
Filip Hanaczewski: converted each night into a Qvd. Document.

300
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:28.400
Filip Hanaczewski: And then that way. There's a single instance of that database table as a Qvd. That can be reused many times, and then the second layer of the 3 pieces would be a data model where you are. You create a Qlik Sense application

301
00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:31.769
Filip Hanaczewski: and using Qvd documents.

302
00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:32.870
Filip Hanaczewski: and

303
00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:39.769
Filip Hanaczewski: you would then design a data model to support a particular domain. So, for instance, finance

304
00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:40.920
Filip Hanaczewski: on.

305
00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:48.230
Filip Hanaczewski: and then that sorry and that data model, it would then be reusable. The objective would be

306
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:49.989
Filip Hanaczewski: a data model that

307
00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:56.349
Filip Hanaczewski: could be reused by anyone who's interested in finance for whatever specific

308
00:30:56.710 --> 00:31:00.470
Filip Hanaczewski: objectives they have. But everyone would be using

309
00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.739
Filip Hanaczewski: the same, the same data.

310
00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:08.319
Filip Hanaczewski: and then the final tier of it would just be in the Ui.

311
00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:14.659
Filip Hanaczewski: We'd make sure that there was a consistent. We'd want to create master dimensions and master measures.

312
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:27.239
Filip Hanaczewski: So, for instance, if finance, if Perkona, for instance, had operating units in different geographies or different market segments that perhaps have a different

313
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:29.859
Filip Hanaczewski: formula for revenue.

314
00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:34.960
Filip Hanaczewski: We would want to create standard master measures for those.

315
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:37.020
Filip Hanaczewski: Exactly. Yes. Yeah.

316
00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:48.989
Filip Hanaczewski: Okay, so. And the good. What I heard you say at the beginning of this call was something akin to beginning modestly and then iterating and scaling. And so

317
00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:55.690
Filip Hanaczewski: what we can do over the we can just use that booking data. Dashboard is an opportunity

318
00:31:56.252 --> 00:32:01.460
Filip Hanaczewski: to to do that. So it sounds like we wanna make things that

319
00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:06.375
Filip Hanaczewski: we'll use this 1st phase I use the phrase,

320
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:25.669
Filip Hanaczewski: I think it's called a self evidencing or self. Basically what it is is the the thing we build will be an example of how to do what you want to do. So the objective is, it won't just be. We need to create booking dashboards. But we need to create booking dashboards

321
00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:28.620
Filip Hanaczewski: in a method in which

322
00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:32.089
Filip Hanaczewski: that deliverable is instructive of how to

323
00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:36.659
Filip Hanaczewski: begin creating other dashboards in other areas of the business.

324
00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:39.890
Filip Hanaczewski: Sounds excellent.

325
00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:44.310
Filip Hanaczewski: Okay, yeah, I don't want to over promise. But I think that's that will be a good approach.

326
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.080
Filip Hanaczewski: That sounds good approach for us.

327
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:56.210
Filip Hanaczewski: right? And that's exactly what I was thinking about this kind of structure, where we will deliver self service for the users that will be educated enough to use it.

328
00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:03.126
Filip Hanaczewski: That's great phrase. So it sounds like, that's really the end game for you.

329
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:11.330
Filip Hanaczewski: okay, yeah. I think that really does kind of it imposes a structure on how

330
00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:13.020
Filip Hanaczewski: you know what.

331
00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:15.699
Filip Hanaczewski: what we're gonna want to get done

332
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:20.150
Filip Hanaczewski: so that you have a chance to work with it. I think it means more of a focus.

333
00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:27.760
Filip Hanaczewski: I think it means more of a focus on the the development process, whether that's in the back end or the front end

334
00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.329
Filip Hanaczewski: and then with the service. Now, Connector.

335
00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.660
Filip Hanaczewski: I think what I'd like to do is

336
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:37.250
Filip Hanaczewski: if we can take a look at that.

337
00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:43.820
Filip Hanaczewski: and then I could just quickly identify. If it's something that's either going to take me too long.

338
00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:49.989
Filip Hanaczewski: or isn't something that I'm capable of getting done. I can just quickly hand off

339
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:55.430
Filip Hanaczewski: that task and the associated hours to someone who does it all day long.

340
00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.540
Filip Hanaczewski: Okay?

341
00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:58.929
Filip Hanaczewski: So I think that way.

342
00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:05.210
Filip Hanaczewski: I'm using my hours effectively. So either I can get it done, or I'm going to get somebody

343
00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.480
Filip Hanaczewski: who can get it done for us.

344
00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:16.229
Filip Hanaczewski: and I won't. I won't distract myself with with the connector. Is it that you want to use the connector strictly within

345
00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:24.019
Filip Hanaczewski: Qlik Sense applications? Or is it that you're using the connector in external applications or pipelines that you're building?

346
00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:31.640
Filip Hanaczewski: I was trying to use it in Qlik Sense. I was trying to connect to ServiceNow, and I was trying to pull in some data

347
00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:33.770
Filip Hanaczewski: directly from ServiceNow.

348
00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:46.619
Filip Hanaczewski: and it didn't work with the normal approach, and then I was by support I was told that I should be using. I should try at least to use the Api calls.

349
00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:58.929
Filip Hanaczewski: and I tried and seemed like some of the tables were were being uploaded, but some of them were problematic, and I'm not sure why it's happening. Maybe it's

350
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.910
Filip Hanaczewski: it might be our data.

351
00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:06.070
Filip Hanaczewski: But if it is, I also would want to understand how we can handle things like that.

352
00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.709
Filip Hanaczewski: Yeah, absolutely. I I doubt it's and well, who knows we.

353
00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:20.000
Filip Hanaczewski: So I feel like we've done a with your help. I think we've done a nice job with covering off on everything the visuals.

354
00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:24.439
Filip Hanaczewski: Those are really just a function of. If we have everything else defined.

355
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:29.258
Filip Hanaczewski: we can just decide. So I think we've covered all of that

356
00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:35.110
Filip Hanaczewski: and I I feel like you've over the course of this conversation. You've covered

357
00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:38.529
Filip Hanaczewski: the project, timeline. Would would that

358
00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:50.769
Filip Hanaczewski: would that be correct? If you like, handle on what you want. One thing I'm going to disadvantage of is my colleagues. Qlik, colleagues have sent me some screenshots of some really excellently

359
00:35:50.910 --> 00:36:06.840
Filip Hanaczewski: documented measure. Definitions and things are those part of something that you put together for this particular effort. It is. Yes, that's probably from the documents that I'm going to send to you. Okay.

360
00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:12.439
Filip Hanaczewski: alright. And those would be associated with the booking booking data.

361
00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:14.640
Filip Hanaczewski: Okay.

362
00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.120
Filip Hanaczewski: that's great. So

363
00:36:17.678 --> 00:36:21.349
Filip Hanaczewski: what I'll do is when we've completed this call

364
00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:25.670
Filip Hanaczewski: I'll receive those and and go through those.

365
00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:33.359
Filip Hanaczewski: And again, it's like a 99% of the instances. I never get that level of documentation. So it's

366
00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:34.750
Filip Hanaczewski: it's great.

367
00:36:35.465 --> 00:36:40.090
Filip Hanaczewski: Is there? Are there any other materials or things like that that

368
00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:44.510
Filip Hanaczewski: I'm going to be able to review, or that you want me

369
00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:46.289
Filip Hanaczewski: to have access to.

370
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:54.039
Filip Hanaczewski: for now we only have this document. That's is is prepared by Amal. So he prepared this, based on

371
00:36:54.340 --> 00:37:09.379
Filip Hanaczewski: his knowledge how it could be prepared. I reviewed it with him, and the level of details that is included here. We we suppose that it is enough, but if it wouldn't, we would want to also understand

372
00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:25.019
Filip Hanaczewski: what kind of level of details would you need to to move on and to understand that the end goal, because it might not be everything. But this is the only document that we have, because the used cases is not that big. So we didn't prepare anything else.

373
00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:27.920
Filip Hanaczewski: Okay, no, I'll I'll

374
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:31.610
Filip Hanaczewski: review it. And again, I rarely.

375
00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:36.749
Filip Hanaczewski: I rarely have anything written. I rarely receive anything that has been written down.

376
00:37:37.177 --> 00:37:47.980
Filip Hanaczewski: Or at least, you know it's handwritten. I'm glad that I'm doing great job. Yes, I mean it does. It sounds like I'm just sucking up to you. But no, this is.

377
00:37:48.190 --> 00:38:00.219
Filip Hanaczewski: you guys seem to really have your ducks in a row, so I'm glad. All right. So, knowing that then I have access to the in in terms of the tenant that I have access to.

378
00:38:01.078 --> 00:38:06.120
Filip Hanaczewski: I'll share my screen here. And let's just make sure.

379
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:07.860
Filip Hanaczewski: See if I have anything

380
00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:09.980
Filip Hanaczewski: that I can drive around to?

381
00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:20.271
Filip Hanaczewski: so just please let me know if you're able to see my screen. See it. Okay.

382
00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.470
Filip Hanaczewski: so

383
00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:24.390
Filip Hanaczewski: is there anything

384
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:28.470
Filip Hanaczewski: you don't see anything? Okay.

385
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:30.869
Filip Hanaczewski: let me go to catalog and see.

386
00:38:33.916 --> 00:38:42.660
Filip Hanaczewski: So I would have to add you to the groups that okay, I know what I have to do. I'll add you to the groups. And

387
00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:48.490
Filip Hanaczewski: do you have 5 min, or just like, Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. I'm your. I'm all yours

388
00:38:48.975 --> 00:38:51.639
Filip Hanaczewski: for for better or for worse, I'm all yours.

389
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:56.709
Filip Hanaczewski: So spaces, I think that's spaces.

390
00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:00.739
Filip Hanaczewski: I was logged out one sec.

391
00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:21.559
Filip Hanaczewski: Yeah, if if possible. And pardon me for talking while you're trying to get stuff done there, but the best for me is to either have root, admin access, or

392
00:39:21.964 --> 00:39:25.090
Filip Hanaczewski: it can walk you through the others so that I can

393
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:30.409
Filip Hanaczewski: be it the admin admin, console, and things like that.

394
00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.780
Filip Hanaczewski: Add member

395
00:39:37.903 --> 00:39:41.676
Filip Hanaczewski: and since I'm a like, I'm an insufferable talker while you're

396
00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:48.290
Filip Hanaczewski: While you're doing that, D, does Perkona have access to Qlik training? Is that something?

397
00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:51.889
Filip Hanaczewski: Because that's helpful for me to know?

398
00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:57.479
Filip Hanaczewski: I think we do, and we, me and Amal, we will attend

399
00:39:58.090 --> 00:39:59.469
Filip Hanaczewski: a training

400
00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:02.360
Filip Hanaczewski: additional training for the visualizations

401
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.200
Filip Hanaczewski: like the like. The

402
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:10.939
Filip Hanaczewski: someone will lead it. I think that's

403
00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:16.919
Filip Hanaczewski: it's like a virtual session for our for 2 days that we will have with Amal.

404
00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:23.489
Filip Hanaczewski: Okay, so that's it you have in person, whether it's virtual or not, it's in person training.

405
00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:25.200
Filip Hanaczewski: Yes, yes.

406
00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:28.582
Filip Hanaczewski: okay. So I'll find out if you have.

407
00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:32.139
Filip Hanaczewski: I don't know if you're able to see my screen. This is

408
00:40:33.134 --> 00:40:34.679
Filip Hanaczewski: it's called Qlik

409
00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:40.819
Filip Hanaczewski: continuous classroom. Exactly. Yeah. I saw this. Do you have access to this?

410
00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:46.650
Filip Hanaczewski: Yes. Oh, great. Okay. So among the things we can do. It'll be.

411
00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:50.429
Filip Hanaczewski: you know, very easy is, we can also

412
00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:58.860
Filip Hanaczewski: put together a curriculum for your new users to take advantage of this, because this training really is excellent. It has.

413
00:40:59.575 --> 00:41:05.099
Filip Hanaczewski: Not only is it very bite size in terms of video instruction, but it comes with

414
00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:08.791
Filip Hanaczewski: quite a bit of sample data,

415
00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:14.959
Filip Hanaczewski: applications that mirror the content that's been reviewed during the

416
00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.219
Filip Hanaczewski: the lessons and things like that.

417
00:41:18.210 --> 00:41:30.619
Filip Hanaczewski: That's exactly what I would want to do with you at the end, when we will be done with 2 main goals. I would want to go through this and just collect like the like. You said the curriculum for the new users that will come in and

418
00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:34.209
Filip Hanaczewski: we'll we will just address the learning curve here.

419
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:39.519
Filip Hanaczewski: Okay, great. So no matter what we get done in the 1st week.

420
00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:43.390
Filip Hanaczewski: As long as we carve out 2 or 3 h

421
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:47.250
Filip Hanaczewski: we'll be able to at a minimum put together

422
00:41:47.834 --> 00:41:56.060
Filip Hanaczewski: roadmaps if you will, for the different user. User segments for for your tenant.

423
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:57.719
Filip Hanaczewski: Great. Okay. Users.

424
00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:06.710
Filip Hanaczewski: Alright to the instance. You should see something more now, maybe. Okay.

425
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:10.660
Filip Hanaczewski: Great. Okay, thanks.

426
00:42:10.850 --> 00:42:12.480
Filip Hanaczewski: The bookings is

427
00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:13.760
Filip Hanaczewski: the one.

428
00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:16.810
Filip Hanaczewski: Probably this one is

429
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:26.300
Filip Hanaczewski: right.

430
00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:29.800
Filip Hanaczewski: And alright. So what a

431
00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:38.265
Filip Hanaczewski: what? I'm gonna be able if you don't mind, I'm gonna go back. What I want to be able to do is look at the data model. So I can see what I have.

432
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:40.230
Filip Hanaczewski: so you're probably missing some

433
00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:41.910
Filip Hanaczewski: privileges right?

434
00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:46.470
Filip Hanaczewski: What I what should I do to give you like

435
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:52.430
Filip Hanaczewski: higher level access, which which privileges should I set?

436
00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:59.790
Filip Hanaczewski: I will take a look for you in just a second. Let me just do so. I want to go to the data load, editor.

437
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:05.400
Filip Hanaczewski: and this is the main things I want to make sure I have access to whatever data connections you want me to have

438
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:07.130
Filip Hanaczewski: access to.

439
00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:11.749
Filip Hanaczewski: So I have Salesforce. But I don't have service. Now.

440
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:16.930
Filip Hanaczewski: let's see, yeah, ServiceNow does exist, because it's it's not here.

441
00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:20.478
Filip Hanaczewski: I'll add you to the second group. Yeah, that's right.

442
00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:28.220
Filip Hanaczewski: And then, if you don't mind, we can. Also, we can walk through. And so now we'll have a video of it.

443
00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:32.749
Filip Hanaczewski: just just specifically what the issue is. And that way.

444
00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:37.250
Filip Hanaczewski: if if I don't think I can solve it for you in a timely manner.

445
00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:44.580
Filip Hanaczewski: I'll pull in someone who can, and I can have them watch that section of the video. So you don't have to go over it again.

446
00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:47.210
Filip Hanaczewski: Okay, I think we should see it.

447
00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:49.310
Filip Hanaczewski: ken.

448
00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:57.269
Filip Hanaczewski: Well, it's it's not in this

449
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:59.740
Filip Hanaczewski: application. It's okay.

450
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:06.200
Filip Hanaczewski: right business services. That should be it.

451
00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:15.860
Filip Hanaczewski: It doesn't show up. Oh, yeah. So I understand. I get it. So it's not in there. Let's see if I'm

452
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:30.330
Filip Hanaczewski: I see. And this is how you where you were encountering an issue. Right? It's just at this, the create connection.

453
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:35.030
Filip Hanaczewski: Yes, this didn't work. And then.

454
00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:40.930
Filip Hanaczewski: within the one of the applications. I have a data load script where I,

455
00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:51.120
Filip Hanaczewski: where I started manipulating the data script, the the load script. And there I was able to identify what was the problem with which table?

456
00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:54.900
Filip Hanaczewski: And but I I not sure. Why?

457
00:44:55.090 --> 00:45:02.600
Filip Hanaczewski: Okay, well, would you? How about we? I turn the you can share your screen. We'll go into that application and take a look.

458
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.980
Filip Hanaczewski: Eric.

459
00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:06.210
Filip Hanaczewski: okay, great

460
00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:09.569
Filip Hanaczewski: right? And is that in terms of

461
00:45:10.611 --> 00:45:13.618
Filip Hanaczewski: data connection? So I have

462
00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:16.600
Filip Hanaczewski: business services

463
00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:22.540
Filip Hanaczewski: and finance, and so do I have what I need. So we have Salesforce bulk.

464
00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.590
Filip Hanaczewski: Are there? Are there any other

465
00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:31.319
Filip Hanaczewski: sources of data like, for instance, for booking data or Salesforce, where the booking data is.

466
00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:34.030
Filip Hanaczewski: Salesforce is where the booking data is.

467
00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:48.619
Filip Hanaczewski: and ServiceNow is going to be used for a different purpose. There will be another application that we will probably join with the Salesforce data. But for now we are just trying to make the connection for ServiceNow.

468
00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:52.870
Arthur Fantaci: Okay, just for my own reference. And

469
00:45:53.090 --> 00:46:08.670
Arthur Fantaci: to ensure I'm using the same business language and business terms that you are, what is Percona's specific use of the ServiceNow platform that generates the data being used by this Qlik Sense dashboard application? Is the data associated with Customer Service by Percona for its customers?

470
00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:11.969
Filip Hanaczewski: I can share my screen. Okay?

471
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:15.450
Arthur Fantaci: Oh, that'd be great. Yeah. Let me stop sharing my screen here.

472
00:46:18.570 --> 00:46:21.019
Arthur Fantaci: I'm not sure how to end my screen sharing. Oh, there you go, you're now sharing your screen. Thank you.

473
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:33.740
Filip Hanaczewski: Right? So my screen is showing the Percona Qlik Cloud Analytics Home page. The applications visible on the page I'm currently sharing will be connecting to Percona's Jira system. I didn't have a lot of problems with the Qlik Jira Data Connector, so for now there will be some things that I might ask you for assistance later on.

474
00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:41.559
Filip Hanaczewski: On my screen now is the Booking Data Dashboard, the application that is using the Qlik Salesforce Data Connector.

475
00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:54.279
Filip Hanaczewski: And on my screen now we have the 'ETR (Entitlement, Time, Review) Synchronization Quality Assurance Dashboard'. The 'ETR' Dashboard uses two Qlik Data Connectors: the Qlik Salesforce Data Connector and the Qlik ServiceNow Data Connector.

476
00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:58.150
Arthur Fantaci: Okay, thank you for showing me these dashboards.

477
00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.150
Filip Hanaczewski: And here on my screen

478
00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:04.260
Filip Hanaczewski: is the Data Load Script Editor from the 'ETR' Dashboard in which I'm

479
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:09.550
Filip Hanaczewski: attempting to load data from Percona's ServiceNow application.

480
00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.270
Filip Hanaczewski: Right, and this is the Data Load Editor Sheet in which I'm using the Qlik ServiceNow Data Connector.

481
00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:16.420
Filip Hanaczewski: And when I attempt to run a reload of this application

482
00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.159
Filip Hanaczewski: an error related to the Qlik ServiceNow Data Connector is thrown and the reload fails.

483
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:40.509
Arthur Fantaci: Thank you for the explanation. I'll get a screenshot just as soon as the Error Message

484
00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:41.860
Arthur Fantaci: pops up on your screen.

485
00:47:55.310 --> 00:47:58.560
Arthur Fantaci: And I'm sorry for having to ask, but what does the 'ETR' stand for in the name of Percona's ETR Dashboard?

486
00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:01.249
Filip Hanaczewski: 'ETR' stands for Entitlement Time Review

487
00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:02.310
Arthur Fantaci: Thank you.

488
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:05.279
Arthur Fantaci: Can you please explain the meaning of 'Entitlement Time Review'?

489
00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:14.550
Filip Hanaczewski: So that is something that we are using as a concept that our Services Department, like Managed Services, are selling block of hours

490
00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:24.029
Filip Hanaczewski: to our customers and the Service Entitlement for the hours that each customer can use

491
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:27.720
Filip Hanaczewski: is what we are calling an Entitlement.

492
00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:39.299
Filip Hanaczewski: Now, this is something that is generated, based on the contract in Salesforce, and we are moving this information to Percona's ServiceNow system, and ServiceNow controls

493
00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:44.439
Filip Hanaczewski: the amount of hours that is being utilized by specific customers.

494
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:50.470
Filip Hanaczewski: And then the 'Entitlement Time Review' refers to a report that is telling us

495
00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:54.130
Filip Hanaczewski: how many hours each customer used

496
00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:56.340
Filip Hanaczewski: for a particular month.

497
00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:01.859
Arthur Fantaci: Alright understood. Thank you. That's really super helpful.

498
00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:16.506
Arthur Fantaci: May I please step away for 15 seconds? I'm gonna leave my microphone on. I'm just going to give my dog, Sadie, a treat so that she

499
00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:19.659
Arthur Fantaci: leaves me in peace here.

500
00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:23.230
Arthur Fantaci: Alright, Sadie? Good job! Here you go, here's a treat for you!

501
00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:25.719
Arthur Fantaci: That's right, Sadie! Good show.

502
00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:41.839
Arthur Fantaci: Alright, Sadie. Let's go!

503
00:49:46.570 --> 00:49:50.340
Arthur Fantaci: Okay, alright, thank you. I appreciate your patience, Filip. We can get back to reviewing your attempt to reload your Qlik Sense application's Data Load Editor script.

504
00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:59.099
Arthur Fantaci: Alright. I'm not going to get excited that your application's reload process hasn't failed yet. I'm assuming the failure doesn't come until later in the reload process?

505
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:01.265
Filip Hanaczewski: Exactly.

506
00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:07.450
Filip Hanaczewski: I'm not sure where which table it was, I think. Oh, that's seems like

507
00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.490
Filip Hanaczewski: Salesforce already.

508
00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:18.350
Arthur Fantaci: Well, it's helpful to know what is working as well. So, has it hit the Error?

509
00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:20.600
Filip Hanaczewski: No.

510
00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.360
Arthur Fantaci: Is this the same Error Message that you received before?

511
00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:26.735
Filip Hanaczewski: No, no, I it's a different thing.

512
00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:36.289
Filip Hanaczewski: I think. I removed the problematic line, the problematic table from the service. Now, Connector, just to see if the rest will be loading fine.

513
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:43.409
Filip Hanaczewski: I'll have to add this back. I think this was problem with task table. And even though we didn't

514
00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:46.110
Filip Hanaczewski: specify particular

515
00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:55.149
Filip Hanaczewski: fields that we would want to ingest like we wanted to, ingest only the 'Id' field

516
00:50:55.250 --> 00:51:03.120
Filip Hanaczewski: and some other specific fields. And the problem with the ingestion was in fields that were not selected by us.

517
00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.640
Filip Hanaczewski: And that's something that I don't understand.

518
00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:10.565
Arthur Fantaci: Okay, yeah, that sounds like something we may want to address somewhere within the scope of this Engagement.

519
00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:14.290
Filip Hanaczewski: Great, that sounds like it should be.

520
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.133
Arthur Fantaci: It sounds

521
00:51:18.295 --> 00:51:29.360
Arthur Fantaci: complex enough that I wanna yeah dive into that a bit more. I I would want to say quickly, though with that circular reference. I think it

522
00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:32.269
Arthur Fantaci: perhaps one of the

523
00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:38.850
Arthur Fantaci: one of the elements we'll include in terms of for the back end and best practices will be

524
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:40.860
Arthur Fantaci: optimizing

525
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:44.680
Arthur Fantaci: the Data Models that are built

526
00:51:44.770 --> 00:51:47.779
Arthur Fantaci: to support the front end Qlik Sense application development (i.e. User Interface Design).

527
00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:50.759
Arthur Fantaci: So, for instance, if we

528
00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:52.590
Arthur Fantaci: if you're able to.

529
00:51:53.285 --> 00:52:01.270
Arthur Fantaci: Instead of the Data Load Editor selection, in the upper left, if we just click the dropdown near there and let's just go to the Data Model Viewer, please.

530
00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:06.810
Arthur Fantaci: And this is also part of I'm ignorant of your background. Do you have a background in

531
00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:16.579
Filip Hanaczewski: like relational database design or anything like that. Oh, yes, in in a lot of things I have background in programming

532
00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:18.970
Filip Hanaczewski: are in zoom.

533
00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:24.770
Arthur Fantaci: So it sounds like, yeah, here this is, you're early in the process of all of your

534
00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:30.289
Arthur Fantaci: testing and development and things. So this this kind of

535
00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:35.519
Arthur Fantaci: so we'll work to make sure, because the same rules would apply

536
00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:38.859
Arthur Fantaci: in building a Qlik Data Model as it would with.

537
00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:43.850
Arthur Fantaci: you know, any type of relational model where you want it to be a dimensional model,

538
00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:50.310
Arthur Fantaci: a Star Schema, or a Snowflake Schema will generally be the most performant for modeling data in Qlik.

539
00:52:50.956 --> 00:52:54.090
Arthur Fantaci: And there are other data modeling techniques, depending on the data volumes and other factors.

540
00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:57.800
Arthur Fantaci: And there are other, you know, techniques or practices.

541
00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:03.409
Arthur Fantaci: Yeah, I'm assuming here, we're you're just.

542
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:08.910
Arthur Fantaci: You're just trying to validate that the connections are working correctly. Is that accurate?

543
00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:12.310
Filip Hanaczewski: Exactly. I was trying to

544
00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:14.250
Filip Hanaczewski: reflect the

545
00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:15.990
Filip Hanaczewski: the query

546
00:53:16.030 --> 00:53:25.139
Filip Hanaczewski: that's I'm using in a different system, currently, because we also have a Metabase. We have this kind of dashboard

547
00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:31.059
Filip Hanaczewski: and I was trying to move it to Qlik. But I that's the problem that I faced.

548
00:53:31.810 --> 00:53:33.859
Filip Hanaczewski: I'm not this. This

549
00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:36.999
Filip Hanaczewski: is probably not something that should exist.

550
00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:43.659
Filip Hanaczewski: but it is something that is necessary for us to understand this, because

551
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:45.050
Filip Hanaczewski: there are

552
00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:50.209
Filip Hanaczewski: in. I would have to show you the relevant query

553
00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:56.250
Filip Hanaczewski: in the Metabase. So you can understand, what are we trying to achieve?

554
00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:59.190
Filip Hanaczewski: It would be easier

555
00:53:59.210 --> 00:54:00.750
Filip Hanaczewski: to do it this way.

556
00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:04.339
Filip Hanaczewski: Let's maybe we do that in

557
00:54:04.850 --> 00:54:13.450
Filip Hanaczewski: in on, you know. Say, tomorrow or Wednesday I will prepare myself for it. I'll I can prepare a document like this

558
00:54:14.238 --> 00:54:18.700
Filip Hanaczewski: where you will have all details what we would want to do with the ETR Dashboard.

559
00:54:18.810 --> 00:54:20.176
Filip Hanaczewski: And then

560
00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:26.160
Filip Hanaczewski: we could go through this when I'm going to be ready for now, I don't think it would be waste of your time.

561
00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:38.479
Arthur Fantaci: Yeah, agreed. I think it's we can be more productive. I can also just show you some techniques that are specific to Qlik in terms of how to overcome Circular Reference issues, like that one.

562
00:54:39.074 --> 00:54:46.980
Filip Hanaczewski: Understood that the data requires. You know that. And

563
00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:51.180
Filip Hanaczewski: that's the only way. It is possible that I'm just not

564
00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:56.560
Filip Hanaczewski: importing the data in the right way, because maybe we don't really need this

565
00:54:56.620 --> 00:55:03.950
Filip Hanaczewski: relations here. And I could just import whole tables and just do the manipulation of the data in a different place.

566
00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:08.669
Filip Hanaczewski: I agree it depending on. And I think it is situated.

567
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:24.599
Arthur Fantaci: It's situationally dependent. And so sure let's put this on the parking lot, and we can. You and I can go through this. I'll better understand it. And but

568
00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:26.359
Filip Hanaczewski: if you could.

569
00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:31.500
Filip Hanaczewski: exactly, if you could modify this application to put back in

570
00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:41.290
Arthur Fantaci: the lines that are generating the able error. Yes, I will do. That would be great, and what I'll do is I'll run it. I'll get that error.

571
00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:42.640
Arthur Fantaci: and then

572
00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:46.460
Arthur Fantaci: I'll just let you know quickly

573
00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:48.180
Arthur Fantaci: whether I can

574
00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:51.180
Arthur Fantaci: address it or I'll get someone to help me.

575
00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:52.650
Arthur Fantaci: And just so you're,

576
00:55:52.800 --> 00:56:03.469
Arthur Fantaci: so we're clear. It's, you know, if I get someone to help me, the hours that would be required would then be carved out of whatever time we have, so it wouldn't be.

577
00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:05.670
Arthur Fantaci: Someone is coming in. And then.

578
00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:09.370
Arthur Fantaci: you know, trying to impose new hours. It's just

579
00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:13.159
Arthur Fantaci: I may delegate this just so I can stay focused on

580
00:56:13.330 --> 00:56:14.639
Arthur Fantaci: other pieces.

581
00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:22.790
Filip Hanaczewski: Sounds great. Yeah, good. Alright. Alright. So what I'd like to do is when it's convenient.

582
00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:24.240
Filip Hanaczewski: if you can.

583
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:31.460
Arthur Fantaci: I guess both. If I'm able to have the video is less important. The transcript would be very important to me.

584
00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:34.149
Arthur Fantaci: and then I'll go through that

585
00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:38.820
Arthur Fantaci: and over the next day I'm going to put together

586
00:56:39.450 --> 00:56:43.600
Arthur Fantaci: a work plan based on what we've shared.

587
00:56:44.180 --> 00:56:46.589
Arthur Fantaci: I would say this did

588
00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:49.990
Arthur Fantaci: I think meeting at least once a day.

589
00:56:50.190 --> 00:56:54.229
Arthur Fantaci: because this is such a short amount of time, it's going to be important.

590
00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:57.810
Arthur Fantaci: So I think, at the at a minimum.

591
00:56:57.970 --> 00:57:01.579
Arthur Fantaci: Well, I guess what would work for you every day this week

592
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:08.350
Arthur Fantaci: for meeting? It doesn't have to be very long in terms of just every day we do a touch base

593
00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:11.980
Filip Hanaczewski: Every weekday morning this week at 9:00 a.m. ET is a convenient time for me.

594
00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:13.620
Arthur Fantaci: Perfect. Okay.

595
00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:16.250
Arthur Fantaci: Yeah. So if

596
00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:25.260
Arthur Fantaci: half an hour, probably. Yeah, it can be. Yes, we can use it as a stand up. And then if we decide, for instance,

597
00:57:25.410 --> 00:57:29.929
Arthur Fantaci: we need to do a different meeting, for instance, to review what we just talked about,

598
00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:35.450
Arthur Fantaci: then we don't need to do the scheduled daily 9:00 a.m. ET meeting that particular day. Because I just anticipate

599
00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:44.869
Arthur Fantaci: that. I just want to make sure we're touching base every day. But let's yes, we'll see how we will do

600
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:58.699
Arthur Fantaci: with the, with the booking data, because that's the most important thing. I will invite Amal to those meetings, so he will be able to explain you any details that you might have questions about regarding the booking data.

601
00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:08.390
Filip Hanaczewski: and we'll see how it will go regarding the development. And if that's going to be necessary. We can have these those meetings, and if not.

602
00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:13.390
Filip Hanaczewski: I'm not. I don't know if you think it is necessary, we can meet.

603
00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:17.299
Filip Hanaczewski: Okay. So one of our one of our

604
00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:23.739
Filip Hanaczewski: needs is also something like cooperation with you. So we will also understand.

605
00:58:23.850 --> 00:58:26.800
Filip Hanaczewski: How are you going to do this? And maybe

606
00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:30.630
Filip Hanaczewski: every day. Maybe that's a good idea. You would

607
00:58:30.750 --> 00:58:32.040
Filip Hanaczewski: show us.

608
00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:38.329
Filip Hanaczewski: How did you do stuff that that was done so we can also learn while you will be doing things.

609
00:58:38.790 --> 00:58:48.560
Arthur Fantaci: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I think that's a great way to go as I'm looking now. I just opened up the Salesforce Data Connection. I'm looking at the tables and things.

610
00:58:49.094 --> 00:59:07.529
Arthur Fantaci: Do I have access the applications I have access to? Will it be clear if the applications as well as the document you're gonna provide me? Will that give me what I need to get up to speed with the particular tables I need to be working with?

611
00:59:07.590 --> 00:59:13.720
Arthur Fantaci: Or are all of the data I need to understand imported into the Booking Data Dashboard?

612
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.129
Filip Hanaczewski: Everything that's needed to prepare the reports

613
00:59:18.737 --> 00:59:21.600
Filip Hanaczewski: are based on the document

614
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:24.520
Filip Hanaczewski: that I'm going to share with you. This is.

615
00:59:24.610 --> 00:59:28.540
Filip Hanaczewski: I prepared this data set based on the

616
00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:29.780
Filip Hanaczewski: export

617
00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:39.030
Filip Hanaczewski: to spreadsheet that we are getting from Salesforce. So every data point that was in that spreadsheet is currently available in

618
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:46.769
Filip Hanaczewski: Qlik. And the document that you will receive from me is referring to those fields which are available in the

619
00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:48.750
Filip Hanaczewski: Booking Data Dashboard Qlik Sense application.

620
00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:54.550
Arthur Fantaci: Okay, alright. Great. Okay. And I'm looking at the Booking Data Dashboard and I see,

621
00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:57.670
Arthur Fantaci: on the 'Dev dashboard' Sheet,

622
00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:01.039
Arthur Fantaci: eight KPI Visualization Objects.

623
01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:08.980
Filip Hanaczewski: Exactly. Those are the numbers that I was trying to compare with a similar report from Salesforce.

624
01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:13.609
Filip Hanaczewski: and we need to be perfectly sure

625
01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:16.729
Filip Hanaczewski: that there are no discrepancies between the data displayed in Percona's Salesforce system and the data displayed in Percona's Qlik Cloud Platform. So

626
01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:24.340
Filip Hanaczewski: we must also be able every day to show you the numbers that we see in Percona's Salesforce system

627
01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:27.250
Filip Hanaczewski: and be able to tie out those numbers with the

628
01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:28.930
Filip Hanaczewski: Qlik Cloud Platform data.

629
01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:33.149
Filip Hanaczewski: Currently, I am not able to achieve a 100%

630
01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:43.250
Filip Hanaczewski: validation of the data from the Salesforce and Qlik systems. There are some issues that we are aware about, like Currency Conversion Rates for the exchange for the various currency types contained in the Salesforce operational data tables,

631
01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:52.049
Filip Hanaczewski: and probably some more issues. But that's something that Amal will be able to explain more. And but all of the things that

632
01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:56.669
Filip Hanaczewski: should have been applied to this data set are in the document

633
01:00:56.890 --> 01:00:58.390
Filip Hanaczewski: that I will send you after this call.

634
01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:01.560
Arthur Fantaci: Right.

635
01:01:01.830 --> 01:01:04.440
Arthur Fantaci: So good. So what I'll do

636
01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:09.410
Arthur Fantaci: will be, you know. Take the transcript. I'll use that to assist me with

637
01:01:10.310 --> 01:01:16.719
Arthur Fantaci: putting together a work plan and deliverables which we can go over tomorrow morning.

638
01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:22.179
Arthur Fantaci: I'm gonna go through the Booking Data Dashboard application along with the document you'll send me

639
01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:24.419
Arthur Fantaci: to understand the Measures used in the Qlik Sense Booking Data Dashboard application.

640
01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:31.659
Arthur Fantaci: And so would part of what you want to accomplish during this first week, or 'Phase One' objectives be for me to focus on the Booking Data Dashboard Qlik Sense application and

641
01:01:32.186 --> 01:01:34.923
Arthur Fantaci: work with you to lay out

642
01:01:35.610 --> 01:01:38.220
Arthur Fantaci: a few Sheets populated with relevant Data Visualizations populated with the Measures contained in the document you're sending me?

643
01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:42.239
Filip Hanaczewski: Yes, with a lot more than me. But yes, exactly.

644
01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:50.759
Arthur Fantaci: Alright. And we know that with the Booking Data Dashboard, you're having issues with getting the data to tie out correctly

645
01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:52.750
Filip Hanaczewski: and

646
01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:54.650
Arthur Fantaci: and the thought.

647
01:01:54.780 --> 01:02:02.570
Arthur Fantaci: So I think that's another one. And maybe that's during the session with them all is we can uncover. He can identify for me

648
01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:03.840
Arthur Fantaci: which

649
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:09.339
Arthur Fantaci: which data, elements or measures aren't tying out

650
01:02:09.743 --> 01:02:13.100
Arthur Fantaci: with the Salesforce database. And then we can dig into that issue.

651
01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:24.390
Filip Hanaczewski: Yes, I'm sure she will be able to point that out. We will be both on the call, so we will definitely be able to guide you, and we will find that. But

652
01:02:24.460 --> 01:02:26.429
Filip Hanaczewski: I'm not able

653
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:35.240
Filip Hanaczewski: to say what exactly is, is wrong with that. At this point we will have to try. The currencies will have to try

654
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:41.519
Filip Hanaczewski: to make sure that the scope of the of the range of the dates is correct.

655
01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:50.429
Filip Hanaczewski: If, yeah, there are couple of filters that are applied on the Salesforce side that I'm not sure if I was applying correctly in Qlik.

656
01:02:50.530 --> 01:03:00.519
Arthur Fantaci: Understood. When could you, Amal and I have an hour to have that meeting? Could we do that by the end of the day tomorrow, Tuesday, July 16, 2024?

657
01:03:01.850 --> 01:03:16.719
Filip Hanaczewski: Most probably by the end of the day I'm not going to be available, because that's going to be very late for me. I'm based in Poland.

658
01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:23.030
Arthur Fantaci: Oh, when I say end of day, I'm sorry. So could we, would it be possible to do tomorrow morning?

659
01:03:23.590 --> 01:03:24.559
Filip Hanaczewski: I'll have like an hour
or 2

660
01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:28.480
Filip Hanaczewski: till end of my day. So that's

661
01:03:28.550 --> 01:03:30.920
Filip Hanaczewski: since I will have a call at

662
01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:32.690
Filip Hanaczewski: 9:30 a.m. ET

663
01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:42.739
Filip Hanaczewski: for an hour, or maybe not an hour. But that's like a team call. So I need to be there, sure I'm out will be free. So he will still be able to help you if you'll be available.

664
01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:48.963
Arthur Fantaci: Yeah. And thank you first of all, pardon me for being ignorant about where you're located.

665
01:03:49.520 --> 01:04:07.479
Arthur Fantaci: 1st of all, just cause I'll be very happy to. But secondly, just because this is a short duration. There's no problem with me taking an earlier call. If that gives you more breathing room. If you want to talk at 7 am Eastern and that makes your life easier. That's great with me. It's no problem.

666
01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:23.470
Filip Hanaczewski: Yeah. So that's fine with me. But Amal is on the West coast? I think so. Alright. So yeah, I think if Amal is the priority in terms of this particular piece, the Booking Data Dashboard.

667
01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:31.180
Arthur Fantaci: Then I would say, as soon as it's convenient for him. I'd like to get that done before the end of the day tomorrow.

668
01:04:31.617 --> 01:04:36.210
Filip Hanaczewski: Let's. I will try to get him on a call

669
01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.340
Filip Hanaczewski: tomorrow.

670
01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:38.680
Filip Hanaczewski: and

671
01:04:38.740 --> 01:05:05.220
Filip Hanaczewski: we will get together. We will meet each other, and you will be able to reach out to him at any time, and you will be able to agree anytime to work with him, because I'm not going to be needed for all the sessions. Okay, will be more interested. And looking at the visualizations, and we'll be able to provide a lot more information about the booking data and requirements for the visualizations. How

672
01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.760
Filip Hanaczewski: he would want to

673
01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:09.480
Filip Hanaczewski: see the

674
01:05:09.810 --> 01:05:15.350
Filip Hanaczewski: slideshow source. Also how to say it. Or if he was using a specific word.

675
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:16.400
Filip Hanaczewski: Okay.

676
01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:17.890
Filip Hanaczewski: like a

677
01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:24.639
Filip Hanaczewski: Storytelling. Exactly. So. He would want to have this kind of Storytelling possibility with couple of

678
01:05:25.649 --> 01:05:28.699
Filip Hanaczewski: dashboards that will be going from a high level

679
01:05:28.830 --> 01:05:32.690
Filip Hanaczewski: details to lower level details with some

680
01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:36.849
Filip Hanaczewski: with some dig ins into the details for particular

681
01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.130
Filip Hanaczewski: in

682
01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:43.519
Filip Hanaczewski: visualization. So he will be able to explain all that.

683
01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:50.203
Arthur Fantaci: Okay, yeah, that's perfect. And then I'm glad we have a chance to confirm that. So you feel free

684
01:05:50.730 --> 01:05:53.229
Arthur Fantaci: to. Just if you want to move

685
01:05:53.490 --> 01:06:02.760
Arthur Fantaci: to the time that we spend, whether it's the daily touching base or meetings where we're getting more into detail, feel free to move those earlier.

686
01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:05.630
Arthur Fantaci: Okay, yeah, so yeah, just

687
01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:12.789
Arthur Fantaci: just so, you know, let's okay. So that sounds great. So that's with them all for the booking dashboards.

688
01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:17.669
Arthur Fantaci: The service. Now, Connector. Once I hear from you, I'll know that

689
01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:23.719
Arthur Fantaci: I can go into the ETR Dashboard Application, replicate that error on my own.

690
01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:28.879
Arthur Fantaci: and then decide whether I handle it or I pass that off.

691
01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:32.480
Arthur Fantaci: I delegate that so that it can be done more efficiently.

692
01:06:32.910 --> 01:06:37.919
Arthur Fantaci: and I feel comfortable that we're on the same page in terms of

693
01:06:38.250 --> 01:06:40.909
Arthur Fantaci: that 3rd piece, the training piece.

694
01:06:41.407 --> 01:06:46.060
Arthur Fantaci: Alright, so say when we meet tomorrow morning I'll have that outline

695
01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:50.020
Arthur Fantaci: for how we want to accomplish, you know, how we want to spend the entire eighty billable hours allocated for this engagement.

696
01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:51.175
Arthur Fantaci: And

697
01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:56.039
Arthur Fantaci: I'll rely on you in terms of

698
01:06:57.020 --> 01:07:03.199
Arthur Fantaci: the, for instance, what we had looked at just a moment ago before, issues with data models,

699
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:06.840
Arthur Fantaci: the circular reference and things.

700
01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:11.810
Arthur Fantaci: If that's something that specific, either we use it as a used case for

701
01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:15.839
Arthur Fantaci: best practices, or it's something that has to be

702
01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:19.976
Arthur Fantaci: resolved in Phase One or Phase Two of the engagement.

703
01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:24.650
Arthur Fantaci: We can go over that as soon as it's convenient for you as well.

704
01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:27.579
Filip Hanaczewski: Sounds great. I just sent you an invite.

705
01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:29.710
Filip Hanaczewski: or the 9 A. M.

706
01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:31.960
Filip Hanaczewski: Sync. Daily Sync.

707
01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:33.769
Filip Hanaczewski: I invited Amal there.

708
01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:42.410
Filip Hanaczewski: and tomorrow we'll discuss any details when Amal will be available to work with you on the details regarding the Booking Data Dashboard.

709
01:07:42.450 --> 01:07:43.760
Filip Hanaczewski: We can start there.

710
01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.890
Arthur Fantaci: That's perfect, much appreciated.

711
01:07:46.170 --> 01:07:51.789
Filip Hanaczewski: And for tomorrow I'll be ready with the ETR Dashboard problems and the ServiceNow

712
01:07:51.830 --> 01:07:57.789
Filip Hanaczewski: synchronization issues. So I'll send you the details, and you will be able to pass it over to someone else.

713
01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:05.010
Arthur Fantaci: All right, that's terrific, and is no, no one else has assisted you. It sounds like, perhaps you had contacted Qlik support.

714
01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:11.599
Filip Hanaczewski: Yes, I can share with you the case that was raised by me.

715
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:19.698
Arthur Fantaci: Yes, please, because, yeah, if you didn't get your problem solved, that's not

716
01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:26.370
Arthur Fantaci: how it's supposed to work. So yes, please do. And then we'll be ready to address it.

717
01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:31.379
Arthur Fantaci: We can at least go over tomorrow, and I'll let you know whether I'll do it or someone else will get it done.

718
01:08:31.630 --> 01:08:35.460
Filip Hanaczewski: Alright. Thank you. Alright. Thank you so much. I hope you have a nice evening.

719
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:38.290
Arthur Fantaci: Thank you. All right. Talk to you tomorrow.

720
01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:40.859
Filip Hanaczewski: Till tomorrow, bye.
